  <h1>Homeward</h1>
  <p>This is the pilot script for a TV show called Homeward. It's my attempt to write something in the "grimdark" genre.</p>
  <p>In a dystopian future, humanity has not only discovered that hell is real and can be visited, but that everyone, no matter how good or evil they were, goes there. A thriving industry of "Rescue Services" makes money by rescuing the deceased wealthy from Hell while using the less fortunate in society to do the dirty work.</p>
  <p>I stopped writing right before the protagonist entered hell because I think I would need to enlist the mind of someone more twisted to come up with what Hell is like.</p>

  <p class="scene">INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - DAY</h2>
<p class="action">
  MICHAEL stands at one end of an opulent hospital room in a nurse’s gown. Classical music and nature sounds can be heard playing. Despite his muscular figure, Michael’s face is compassionate and welcoming. MRS. ROBINSON stands on a chair opposite Michael. Her wrinkled face is in utter horror.
  
</p>
<p class="speaker">MRS. ROBINSON</p>
<p class="parenthetical">Terrified</p>
<p class="dialogue">No! Don’t come any closer! Stay back!</p>
<p class="speaker">MICHAEL</p>
<p class="dialogue">Mrs. Robinson, there’s nothing to fear.</p>
<p class="speaker">MRS. ROBINSON</p>
<p class="dialogue">You’re a mimic! I know it!</p>
<p class="speaker">MICHAEL</p>
<p class="dialogue">I’d like you to take a big breath in.</p>
<p class="action">Michael breathes deeply. Mrs. Robinson pauses briefly then starts taking a breath. Her face is still concerned.</p>
<p class="speaker">MICHAEL</p>
<p class="dialogue">And out.</p>
<p class="action">Mrs. Robinson breathes out and seems more relaxed.</p>
<p class="speaker">MICHAEL</p>
<p class="dialogue">You have nothing to worry about. I'm not a mimic. You're safe now. Remember, Mrs. Robinson, you were rescued a month ago.</p>
<p class="action">Mrs. Robinson nods</>
<p class="speaker">MICHAEL</p>
<p class="dialogue">My name is Michael Smith. I'll be taking care of you now.</p>
<p class="speaker">MRS. ROBINSON</p>
<p class="dialogue">What happened to Ray?</p>
<p class="speaker">MICHAEL</p>
<p class="dialogue">Ray needed to leave for other business, but I'm here for you. Remember everyone here wants to help you and care for you. You're safe.</p>
<p class="action">Mrs. Robinson relaxes a bit, then looks up and begins to tense up again.</p>
<p class="speaker">MRS. ROBINSON</p>
<p class="dialogue">What's behind that door?</p>
<p class="speaker">MICHAEL</p>
<p class="dialogue">That's the hallway.</p>
<p class="speaker">MRS. ROBINSON</p>
<p class="dialogue">No... No you're lying. There's a stalker behind that door, isn't there?</p>
<p class="speaker">MICHAEL</p>
<p class="dialogue">There's not a stalker behind the door, Mrs. Robinson. You're safe.</p>
<p class="action">Michael begins to move to open the door.</p>
<p class="speaker">MRS. ROBINSON</p>
<p class="dialogue">No! No! Don't do it! Don't let it in.</p>
<p class="speaker">MICHAEL</p>
<p class="dialogue">Okay, Mrs. Robinson. I'm not going to open the door. But, I assure you that there is nothing to worry...</p>
<p class="action">The door opens and a doctor steps in. Mrs. Robinson lets out a blood curling scream.</p>
<p class="scene">INT. MARTA TRAIN - dusk</p>
<p class="action">Michael faces backwards on a subway. Outside the window a large building with the sign reading "Northside Hospital" can be seen disappearing into the distance. The train passes suburbs with large mansions, many with walls and gates. The atmosphere is depressing and grey.</p>
<p class="action">Michael stares out the window emotionlessly until the train passes into a tunnel. The camera pans upward to reveal the Atlanta skyline dominated by a large rectangular skyscraper. At the top is a large sign with a depiction of one hand helping another followed by the text "HOMEWARD"</p>
<p class="scene">INT. FIVE POINTS STATION - dusk</p>
<p class="action">Michael moves off the train and begins walking to another platform. Near the walkway is a table surrounded by people wearing business casual and holding clipboards. A banner reads "Become a Homeward Hero. Join the Homeward Rescue Forces Today". One of the people approaches Michael.</p>
<p class="speaker">Recruiter</p>
<p class="dialogue">Hello sir, my name is John, what's your name.</p>
<p class="action">Michael is visibly annoyed</p>
<p class="speaker">MICHAEL</p>
<p class="dialogue">... Michael.</p>
<p class="speaker">RECRUITER</p>
<p class="dialogue">Well, Michael it's a pleasure to meet you, do you have a few moments to talk about saving lives through the Homeward Rescue Forces?</p>
<p class="speaker">MICHAEL</p>
<p class="dialogue">I'm not interested.</p>
<p class="speaker">RECRUITER</p>
<p class="dialogue">I understand, sir, I understand. But did you know that Homeward offers a very competitive salary. Many of our heroes receive $100,000 in their first year as compensation.</p>
<p class="speaker">MICHAEL</p>
<p class="dialogue">I said I'm not interested.</p>
<p class="action">Michael pushes the recruiter and boards his next train.</p>
<p class="scene">EXT. WEST ATLANTA - dusk</p>
<p class="action">Michael exits the train station. There's a group of homeless people outside muttering incoherently. Michael accidentally makes eye contact with one.</p>
<p class="speaker">Homeless Man</p>
<p class="dialogue">Mimic... Mimic!</p>
<p class="action">Micheal quickly turns away and begins walking down the street at a brisk pace. A large billow of white steam can be seen rising over the treeline.</p>
<p class="scene">EXT. WEST ATLANTA - night</p>
<p class="action">Michael walks down a dimly lit street. Around him houses and businesses lie in disrepair. He passes a boarded up church vandalized with graffiti reading "There is no salvation."</p>
<p class="action">A man appears in an intersection behind Michael. His body movements indicate a degree of insanity.</p>
<p class="speaker">Insane Man</p>
<p class="dialogue">Hey. Hey you!</p>
<p class="action">Michael continues to walk.</p>
<p class="speaker">INSANE MAN</p>
<p class="dialogue">Hey, I'm talking to you.</p>
<p class="action">The man waits for Michael to respond. Then begins running towards him.</p>
<p class="action">Michael turns around, draws a pistol and points it at the man.</p>
<p class="speaker">MICHAEL</p>
<p class="dialogue">You take another step and I shoot.</p>
<p class="action">The man stops immediately.</p>
<p class="speaker">INSANE MAN</p>
<p class="dialogue">Okay, okay. Just... just don't send me back.</p>
<p class="action">Michael observes a tatoo on the man's neck of one hand helping another.</p>
<p class="speaker">INSANE MAN</p>
<p class="dialogue">I don't want to go back. Don't make me go back.</p>
<p class="speaker">MICHAEL</p>
<p class="dialogue">I don't want to hurt you. Just walk the other direction.</p>
<p class="action">The man slowly begins to back up. Michael stands his ground.</p>
<p class="speaker">MICHAEL</p>
<p class="dialogue">Keep going.</p>
<p class="action">The man keeps moving down the street. Once he's out of sight Michael lowers his gun.</p>
<p class="scene">INT. MICHAEL’S HOUSE - night</>
<p class="action">Michael slams the front door and secures it with 6 additional locks.</p>
<p class="scene">INT. MICHAEL’S KITCHEN - night</p>
<p class="action">JULIE is sitting at the kitchen table looking at a laptop when Michael walks in. She gets up and gives him a kiss.</p>
<p class="speaker">MICHAEL</p>
<p class="dialogue">How did your day go.</p>
<p class="speaker">Julie</p>
<p class="parenthetical">Sighs</p>
<p class="dialogue">The Boys' school was cancelled again. Something about an incident with a discharged Homeward soldier.</p>
<p class="speaker">MICHAEL</p>
<p class="dialogue">Yeah it's getting worse. I had an encounter with one on my way home.</p>
<p class="speaker">JULIE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Oh my gosh, Michael, are you okay?</p>
<p class="speaker">MICHAEL</p>
<p class="dialogue">I'm fine. I had my gun.</p>
<p class="speaker">JULIE</p>
<p class="dialogue">You know that makes me nervous. You have to walk all that way for that... job.</p>
<p class="speaker">MICHAEL</p>
<p class="dialogue">It pays well, Julie. I can handle myself.</p>
<p class="speaker">JULIE</p>
<p class="dialogue">I still don't like it.</p>
<p class="action">Michael turns to the laptop.</p>
<p class="speaker">MICHAEL</p>
<p class="dialogue">How's your search going?</p>
<p class="speaker">JULIE</p>
<p class="dialogue">I looked all day. Didn't find anything. No one feels safe out there. There aren't any restaurants hiring. There's no customers.</p>
<p class="action">Michael gives Julie a hug.</p>
<p class="speaker">JULIE</p>
<p class="dialogue">I'm scared, Michael.</p>
<p class="speaker">MICHAEL</p>
<p class="dialogue">I know. I know.</p>
<p class="action">Julie looks into Michael's eyes</p>
<p class="speaker">JULIE</p>
<p class="dialogue">We can't live here anymore.</p>
<p class="action">Michael hesitates and Julie gestures to her computer.</p>
<p class="speaker">JULIE</p>
<p class="dialogue">I've been doing some research and... I think we should move to Augusta.</p>
<p class="speaker">MICHAEL</p>
<p class="dialogue">What?</p>
<p class="speaker">JULIE</p>
<p class="dialogue">It's safe, and the community's friendly.</p>
<p class="speaker">MICHAEL</p>
<p class="dialogue">Did you figure that out just by reading a website?</p>
<p class="speaker">JULIE</p>
<p class="dialogue">No. The rescue business is tearing Atlanta apart. It's not in Augusta. No Homeward. No FRS. It's just a normal city.</p>
<p class="speaker">MICHAEL</p>
<p class="dialogue">Do you have a job in Augusta?</p>
<p class="speaker">JULIE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Not yet.</p>
<p class="speaker">MICHAEL</p>
<p class="dialogue">Yet!? And how long do you think that will take?</p>
<p class="speaker">JULIE</p>
<p class="dialogue">I don't know.</p>
<p class="speaker">MICHAEL</p>
<p class="dialogue">I have a job now. I can pay the rent and get food on the table now. And we're going to give that up to move to some random place.</p>
<p class="speaker">JULIE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Michael, I...</p>
<p class="speaker">MICHAEL</p>
<p class="dialogue">You would risk the stability we have. We're finally paying down our debt. You realize that moving could put our family out on the street!</p>
<p class="speaker">JULIE</p>
<p class="parenthetical">Yells</p>
<p class="dialogue">I don't want you getting killed. I can't stand to think of you in...</p>
<p class="speaker">MICHAEL</p>
<p class="parenthetical">Yells</p>
<p class="dialogue">I said NO!</p>
<p class="action">Julie begins to cry and Michael's face softens as he goes to hold her.</p>
<p class="speaker">MICHAEL</p>
<p class="dialogue">I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I didn't mean to yell at you. *sigh* Look, I know. It's hard. I'm afraid for y'all every day. It's just that there's so many things that could go wrong... maybe we should move, but moving's expensive, and we just don't have to money right now.</p>
<p class="action">Julie nods.</p>
<p class="speaker">MICHAEL</p>
<p class="dialogue">But, maybe that doesn't mean we have to stay here. Give it a few months. I'll have more money saved up. And maybe that will be enough to support us while we look for jobs in Augusta.</p>
<p class="speaker">JULIE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Okay</p>
<p class="speaker">MICHAEL</p>
<p class="dialogue">Okay</p>
<p class="scene">INT. KIDS BEDROOM - night</p>
<p class="action">Michael opens the door quietly to see JEROME and ANTHONY asleep. He begins to close the door.</p>
<p class="speaker">Anthony</p>
<p class="dialogue">Dad?</p>
<p class="action">Michael opens the door again and slips into the room.</p>
<p class="speaker">MICHAEL</p>
<p class="parenthetical">Hushed</p>
<p class="dialogue">Hey. What are you doing awake.</p>
<p class="speaker">ANTHONY</p>
<p class="dialogue">I heard you and Mom arguing.</p>
<p class="speaker">MICHAEL</p>
<p class="dialogue">We weren't arguing. It's just... we were having a discussion about money.</p>
<p class="speaker">ANTHONY</p>
<p class="dialogue">Travis Mills' dad joined Homeward, now he says they have lots of money.</p>
<p class="speaker">MICHAEL</p>
<p class="dialogue">You don't want me to join Homeward.</p>
<p class="speaker">ANTHONY</p>
<p class="dialogue">Why not?</p>
<p class="speaker">MICHAEL</p>
<p class="dialogue">Well, I'd be out... there. I wouldn't get to see you growing into a bright young man. And you'd miss out on my sandwiches.</p>
<p class="speaker">ANTHONY</p>
<p class="dialogue">No, not the sandwiches!</p>
<p class="speaker">MICHAEL</p>
<p class="dialogue">Yes the sandwiches.</p>
<p class="action">They both smile at each other.</p>
<p class="speaker">ANTHONY</p>
<p class="dialogue">Dad?</p>
<p class="speaker">MICHAEL</p>
<p class="dialogue">Yeah, Anthony?</p>
<p class="speaker">ANTHONY</p>
<p class="dialogue">Do you think Salvation is actually possible?</p>
<p class="speaker">MICHAEL</p>
<p class="dialogue">I...</p>
<p class="speaker">ANTHONY</p>
<p class="dialogue">Reverend Williams says it is.</p>
<p class="speaker">MICHAEL</p>
<p class="dialogue">Who's Reverend Williams?</p>
<p class="action">Anthony hands Michael a pamphlet from under his pillow. It reads "Hear the good word. The path to Salvation is now discovered"</p>
<p class="speaker">ANTHONY</p>
<p class="dialogue">He says there are 12 rules for avoiding the underworld.</p>
<p class="dialogue">Michael opens the pamphlet to see 12 sections. The header for the first section reads "Participate in the Holy Tithe"</p>
<p class="speaker">MICHAEL</p>
<p class="dialogue">Where did you get this?</p>
<p class="speaker">ANTHONY</p>
<p class="dialogue">A man gave it to me on the street.</p>
<p class="speaker">MICHAEL</p>
<p class="dialogue">Let's stop taking religious advice from men on the street okay?</p>
<p class="speaker">ANTHONY</p>
<p class="dialogue">Okay.</p>
<p class="speaker">MICHAEL</p>
<p class="dialogue">Get some sleep now. I'll see you in the morning.</p>
<p class="speaker">ANTHONY</p>
<p class="dialogue">Okay. Good night.</p>
<p class="speaker">MICHAEL</p>
<p class="dialogue">I love you.</p>
<p class="speaker">ANTHONY</p>
<p class="dialogue">I love you too.</p>
<p class="action">Michael gets up and looks over a Jerome who is still fast asleep. He gently closes the door as he exits the room.</p>
<p class="scene">INT. HOMEWARD BOARDROOM - day</p>
<p class="action">LAUREN peers out the window on a perfect view of the Midtown Atlanta skyline surrounded by clean and elegant board room. Pictures of elderly people smiling surrounded by loved ones adorn the wall next to a large Homeward logo.</p>
<p class="action">JACOB enters the board room.</p>
<p class="speaker">JACOB</p>
<p class="dialogue">What is it.</p>
<p class="speaker">Lauren</p>
<p class="dialogue">More violence in West Atlanta</p>
<p class="speaker">JACOB</p>
<p class="dialogue">Tell me something else that's new.</p>
<p class="action">Lauren gestures to a tablet that's playing a video of discharged soldiers beating innocents.</p>
<p class="speaker">LAUREN</p>
<p class="dialogue">This was posted about an hour ago. Anyone with a degree of competency can identify the aggressors as discharged Homeward Heroes.</p>
<p class="speaker">JACOB</p>
<p class="dialogue">So what? They're discharged, not heroes anymore. We're not liable for them.</p>
<p class="speaker">LAUREN</p>
<p class="dialogue">My concern isn't from a legal perspective. It's bad optics.</p>
<p class="speaker">JACOB</p>
<p class="dialogue">So, what do you suggest?</p>
<p class="speaker">LAUREN</p>
<p class="dialogue">It'll be expensive, but I've already contacted the search providers and we can algorithmically suppress this. Hope it goes away, and in case it doesn't I'll start seeding proof of our innocence so we can eventually spin this as a conspiracy theory. Everything's set up, I just need you to give the go-ahead.</p>
<p class="speaker">JACOB</p>
<p class="dialogue">We're one month away from an IPO. You're right, we can't afford a PR disaster. Spare no expense.</p>
<p class="speaker">LAUREN</p>
<p class="dialogue">Will do.</p>
<p class="action">Jacob walks out of the room leaving Lauren to stare out the window for a moment before leaving as well.</p>
<p class="scene">INT. HOSPITAL HALLWAY - Day</p>
<p class="action">A man struggles to break free of two nurses.</p>
<p class="speaker">Discharged Soldier</p>
<p class="dialogue">Let go of me! You can't trick me. I know what you really are, mimics!</p>
<p class="speaker">Nurse 1</p>
<p class="dialogue">Sir, I'm going to need you to calm down.</p>
<p class="speaker">DISCHARGED SOLDIER</p>
<p class="dialogue">I said, let me go!</p>
<p class="action">Michael notices the situation and puts down the food tray he was carrying. He runs over to help.</p>

<p class="dialogue">Hello, my name is Michael Smith. I'm a nurse. We're here to help. What's your name.</p>
<p class="speaker">DISCHARGED SOLDIER</p>
<p class="dialogue">I'm not telling you shit.</p>
<p class="speaker">NURSE 1</p>
<p class="dialogue">It's Randy Hoffman.</p>
<p class="action">Michael notices the Homeward symbol tatooed on his neck.</p>
<p class="speaker">MICHAEL</p>
<p class="dialogue">Randy, I want you to take a deep breath with me.</p>
<p class="speaker">Discharged Soldier</p>
<p class="dialogue">Get out of my face!</p>

<p class="speaker">MICHAEL</p>
<p class="dialogue">Go get a sedative.</p>
<p class="action">Nurse 2 nods and hands the discharged soldier's arm to Michael who takes firm control over it.</p>
<p class="speaker">MICHAEL</p>
<p class="dialogue">Randy, you're safe now. We're here to help.</p>
<p class="speaker">DISCHARGED SOLDIER</p>
<p class="dialogue">You expect me to believe that? There's no way I'm back in the overworld.</p>
<p class="action">Nurse 2 returns and hands a syringe to Michael who administers it to the discharged soldier. The soldier relaxes.</p>
<p class="speaker">Nurse 2</p>
<p class="dialogue">What was that all about?</p>
<p class="speaker">NURSE 1</p>
<p class="dialogue">First time, huh? They always think we're mimics. Makes sense though. You'd think so too if you just spent the last year getting lured in by creatures pretending to show you the comfort of home.</p>
Nurse 1 wheels over a nearby stretcher and the three of them work to move the discharged soldier on it.
<p class="speaker">NURSE 1</p>
<p class="dialogue">Yeah I guess.</p>
<p class="speaker">NURSE 1</p>
<p class="dialogue">You'll get used to it. All just becomes part of the job eventually.</p>
<p class="action">Michael glares at Nurse 1 but is ignored.</p>
<p class="speaker">NURSE 1</p>
<p class="dialogue">This one was lucky though. He at least went to the underworld by choice.</p>
<p class="speaker">NURSE 1</p>
<p class="dialogue">What do you mean?</p>
<p class="speaker">NURSE 1</p>
<p class="dialogue">He's obviously a Homeward Hero. Given he can afford to be here, he actually got the 100k from making it at least a year.</p>
<p class="speaker">NURSE 1</p>
<p class="dialogue">Ah</p>
<p class="speaker">NURSE 1</p>
<p class="dialogue">Yeah, but $100,000 worth of therapy doesn't go very far. I'll bet you 10 bucks he doesn't even make it to step 3 of the program.</p>
<p class="action">They finish loading the soldier onto the stretcher and Nurse 1 turns to Michael</p>
<p class="speaker">NURSE 1</p>
<p class="dialogue">Thanks man, we can take it from here.</p>

<p class="dialogue">Ah James. A pleasure as always. What can I do for you?</p>

<p class="dialogue">You know why I'm calling. I'm at my wits end with these discharged soldiers being dumped in my district. My constituents are getting hospitalized. It's only a matter of time before someone dies.</p>
<p class="speaker">LAUREN</p>
<p class="parenthetical">Acts surprised</p>
<p class="dialogue">Has there been an incident?</p>
<p class="speaker">COUNCILMAN JOHNSON</p>

<p class="speaker">LAUREN</p>
<p class="dialogue">Hmm. I haven't heard anything.</p>
<p class="speaker">COUNCILMAN JOHNSON</p>
<p class="dialogue">Don't act dumb with me. We both know these violent instigators are dischaged Homeward soldiers.</p>
<p class="speaker">LAUREN</p>
<p class="dialogue">You mean Homeward heroes. And the key word here is discharged. Even if they once worked for Homeward, once they're off the payroll, they become the city's civic duty. We have no liability.</p>
<p class="speaker">COUNCILMAN JOHNSON</p>
<p class="dialogue">That may be, but in that case, you can be assured that I'll do everything in my power remove your generous tax break.</p>
<p class="action">This catches Lauren's attention. She leans in.</p>

<p class="dialogue">Don't change the subject. That happened years ago.</p>
<p class="speaker">LAUREN</p>
<p class="dialogue">Certainly, but it's never too late to commend a survivor. It's fantastic you've been in remission for a few years now, but there's always a threat of it coming back.</p>

<p class="speaker">COUNCILMAN JOHNSON</p>
<p class="dialogue">What are you getting at?</p>
<p class="speaker">LAUREN</p>
<p class="dialogue">How long will it be before your trip to the underworld? A year? A month? I'm sure you know what awaits you there.</p>
<p class="action">Councilman Johnson is silent but fearful.</p>
<p class="speaker">LAUREN</p>
<p class="dialogue">Rescue operations are not cheap, councilman. Do you have a rescue fund saved up?</p>
<p class="action">Councilman Johnson is silent.</p>
<p class="speaker">LAUREN</p>
<p class="dialogue">Well, even if you don't, you're lucky that you have such a good relationship with us over here at Homeward. We always love taking care of our friends.</p>
<p class="action">Councilman Johnson pauses.</p>
<p class="speaker">COUNCILMAN JOHNSON</p>
<p class="dialogue">I think we're on the same page.</p>
<p class="speaker">LAUREN</p>
<p class="dialogue">Fantastic. And since you're such an understanding friend, you can empathize with the fact that Homeward's rescue operations require an immense amount of logistic overhead. There are bound to be things that seep through the cracks.</p>
<p class="speaker">COUNCILMAN JOHNSON</p>
<p class="dialogue">Of course, it's all the price of doing business. We're proud to have Homeward in our city.</p>
<p class="speaker">LAUREN</p>

<p class="dialogue">The pleasure is mine. Goodbye.</p>
<p class="scene">EXT. WEST ATLANTA - night</p>
<p class="action">Michael exits the subway station and notices no homeless people. The streets are even more empty and silent than before.</p>
<p class="action">He continues to walk undisturbed until he reaches his house and freezes. The door is ripped off its hinges.</p>
<p class="action">Michael draws out his gun and rushes to enter the house.</p>
<p class="scene">INT. MICHAEL’S HOUSE - night</p>
<p class="speaker">MICHAEL</p>
<p class="dialogue">Julie! Boys!</p>
<p class="action">There's no response but a sound can be heard from the kitchen.</p>
<p class="scene">INT. MICHAEL’S KITCHEN - night</p>
<p class="action">The insane man from before is crouched down rummaging through the refrigerator.</p>
<p class="speaker">MICHAEL</p>
<p class="dialogue">Hey!</p>
<p class="action">The insane man is startled and starts to run for the door. Michael shoots him in the leg and he falls over.</p>
<p class="speaker">INSANE MAN</p>
<p class="dialogue">Please... please don't.</p>
<p class="speaker">MICHAEL</p>
<p class="dialogue">Where are they!</p>
<p class="action">The insane man timidly points above him.</p>
<p class="action">Michael runs up the stairs. He is surrounded by overturned furniture and other signs of struggle as he checks each room.</p>
<p class="scene">INT. KIDS BEDROOM - night</p>
<p class="action">Michael pauses as he stares at the limp bodies of his family. He moves in to check each of their pulses and breaks down in tears. His face scrunches with anger.</p>
<p class="scene">INT. MICHAEL’S KITCHEN - night</p>
<p class="action">Michael moves into the kitchen and cocks his gun.</p>
<p class="speaker">INSANE MAN</p>
<p class="dialogue">I'm sorry... please... I don't want to go back.</p>
<p class="action">Michael shoots the man in the head.</p>
<p class="action">Intense music begins to build.</p>
<p class="scene">EXT. MICHEAL’S BACKYARD - Dawn</p>
<p class="action">Michael digs three graves, places his loved ones inside and fills in the dirt.</p>
<p class="scene">INT. FIVE POINTS STATION - dawn</p>
<p class="action">Michael walks directly to the recruitment table.</p>
<p class="speaker">RECRUITER</p>
<p class="dialogue">Hello sir, would you be interested...</p>
<p class="action">Michael pulls this clipboard away from the recruiter and begins to write on it.</p>
<p class="speaker">RECRUITER</p>
<p class="dialogue">Well, I appreciate your enthusiasm.</p>
<p class="scene">EXT. FIVE POINTS BUS STATION - dawn</p>
<p class="action">A charter bus waits outside decorated with the words "Homeward Heroes". Michael boards.</p>
<p class="action">The bus drives out of the populated part of Atlanta until it reaches a facility on the Chattahoochee river. A large nuclear cooling tower spews white steam.</p>
<p class="scene">INT. HOMEWARD FACILITY - day</p>
<p class="action">Michael steps off the bus and makes his way into the facility. He joins a crowd of recruits. CAPTAIN RASTER stands in the front of the room next to a circular hole connected to heavy machinery.</p>
<p class="speaker">Captain raster</p>
<p class="dialogue">Recruits, today you take your first steps into a new life. I'm sure y'all had some idea what you were getting into when you signed up, but I can guarantee you until you've experienced it yourself, you have no idea what it's like. Rescue operations are not easy, but I assure you it will all be worth it. Congratulations! Today you've become heroes. Welcome to hell.</p>
<p class="action">The sound of machinery fills the air as a crimson red portal fills the hole next to Raster.</p>
<p class="action">Michael stares at it with determination.</p>
