  <h1>Atlantasy</h1>
  <p>I was watching "The Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt," when I got inspired to create a Sitcom pilot. I love any show made by Tina Fey. "Great News" was great, and I think "30 Rock" is my favorite sitcom of all time. I love the campy, carefree style of writing. But I noticed that almost every Tina Fey project has a bit of New York City pride in it. So, I though, "Why can't I do that for Atlanta?"</p>
  <p>The result is "Atlantasy." To be honest, I might have gone a bit overboard with the Atlanta pride thing to the point where it feels like an ad commissioned by the City of Atlanta. But, it was still fun to write.</p>

<p class="scene">EXT. CG INTRO - day</p>
<p class="action">A Game-of-Thrones-like CGI intro plays as it pans over a map towards the southern United States. A deep, epic voice begins to narrate.</p>
<p class="speaker">Epic Voice (V.O.)</p>
<p class="dialogue">Legend tells of a long forgotten land to the South. A land where the rivers and lakes overflow with sweet tea... or at least they would if it were near any major bodies of water.</p>
<p class="action">Towers begin to sprout out from a forest forming the Atlanta skyline.</p>
<p class="speaker">EPIC VOICE (V.O.)</p>
<p class="dialogue">A land that once hosted the 1996 Olympic games and more than two decades later will not shut up about it. A land of sorrow and tragedy as well as heroes and triumphs.</p>
<p class="scene">INT. MANHATTAN BOARD ROOM - day</p>
<p class="action">A group of well-dressed men sit around a long conference table. Behind them is a wall of floor to ceiling windows providing a perfect view of the Midtown Manhattan skyline. At the front of the table is a well groomed man of 60 years, MR. HOPKINS. EPIC VOICE guy stands at the front of the room by a presentation.</p>
<p class="action">CHADWICK WILLIAMS - age 25, elegantly dressed with slicked back hair - sits at the table towards the back. He is not paying attention, playing with his pen. His coworkers take notice and once rolls his eyes.</p>
<p class="speaker">EPIC VOICE (CONT'D)</p>
<p class="dialogue">This land, gentlemen, is the perfect place to put a satellite office for Roger Hopkins & Burke. Any questions?</p>
<p class="action">The room is silent for a moment.</p>
<p class="speaker">Mr. Hopkins</p>
<p class="dialogue">Well, we appreciate you coming on behalf of the mayor's office. Is there any feedback?</p>
<p class="action">Mr. Hopkins looks around the room.</p>
<p class="speaker">MR. HOPKINS</p>
<p class="dialogue">Charles?</p>
<p class="action">A tall young man with blonde hair perks up.</p>
<p class="sepaker">Charles</p>
<p class="dialogue">Well, it is rather quaint. It might be a good location for some of our lawyers with less talent.</p>
<p class="action">He eyes Chadwick who sinks lower in his seat. The room snickers.</p>
<p class="speaker">MR. HOPKINS</p>
<p class="dialogue">Indeed. Be that as it may, I don't think we're in need of any satellite offices, so thank you for your time, and keep us posted of any new opportunities.</p>
<p class="speaker">EPIC VOICE</p>
<p class="dialogue">There's a generous tax incentive for...</p>

<p class="speaker">CINDY</p>
<p class="dialogue">What is it my love.</p>
<p class="speaker">CHADWICK</p>
<p class="dialogue">An amazing opportunity has presented itself. I know I'm just a Manhattan finance lawyer working for a major lawfirm, but have you ever wondered if there's more? Is it time to set out and find my fortune?</p>
<p class="speaker">CINDY</p>
<p class="dialogue">Yes! I wonder that every day.</p>
<p class="speaker">CHADWICK</p>
<p class="dialogue">Then run away with me! Let's leave this town behind.</p>

<p class="dialogue">Nope</p>

<p class="scene">INT. FOODLIVERY OFFICE - day</p>
<p class="action">Aisha silently walks to her desk, pulls her mac book from her backpack and opens it. She stares at the screen. Her calendar has an event labeled "Performance Review" starting in five minutes.</p>
<p class="action">She looks over to a conference room with a glass door. A group of men are gathered around a table talking and laughing.</p>
<p class="action">Time passes and fifteen minutes into the scheduled meeting the men leave the room and return to their desks. Aisha looks over to RAYMOND, a thin man with long hair. She gets up and walks over to him.</p>
<p class="speaker">AISHA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Um... hey, Raymond.</p>
<p class="speaker">Raymond</p>
<p class="dialogue">Sup, dude?</p>
<p class="speaker">AISHA</p>

<p class="action">Aisha jumps. Raymond closes the door behind him and sits in a chair backways.</p>
<p class="speaker">RAYMOND</p>
<p class="dialogue">So, I don't think this really needs to be that long. You're doing a really good job. I don't really have any feedback. Any questions for me?</p>
<p class="speaker">AISHA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Oh. Uh. I don't think so.</p>
<p class="speaker">RAYMOND</p>
<p class="dialogue">Well awesome, dude. Cool that we had this chat.</p>
<p class="action">He reaches out with a fist. Aisha bumps it awkwardly. He gets up to open the door.</p>
<p class="speaker">AISHA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Wait. I was wondering if we could talk about a promotion to L3.</p>
<p class="action">Raymond sits back down.</p>
<p class="speaker">RAYMOND</p>
<p class="dialogue">Yeah yeah. What's on your mind.</p>
<p class="speaker">AISHA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Well, I've been at Foodlivery for two years.</p>
<p class="speaker">RAYMOND</p>
<p class="dialogue">Two awesome years, am I right?</p>
<p class="speaker">AISHA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Yeah, awesome years. I was just thinking that that's usually when you get promoted.</p>
<p class="speaker">RAYMOND</p>
<p class="dialogue">Hey, my man. These years were awesome right?</p>
<p class="speaker">AISHA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Yeah, really awesome.</p>
<p class="speaker">RAYMOND</p>
<p class="dialogue">And Foodlivery has grown a lot. It's really hectic. It's just not promotion time yet.</p>
<p class="speaker">AISHA</p>
<p class="dialogue">I see. Well, then maybe I could take on a little more responsibility. I just want to do something with a higher impact than API integrations. I could join that new food deserts initiative.</p>
<p class="speaker">RAYMOND</p>
<p class="dialogue">Yeah that sounds dope. Though I don't know anyone who's working on that division so...</p>
<p class="speaker">AISHA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Well, maybe I could ask Chuck.</p>
<p class="speaker">RAYMOND</p>
<p class="dialogue">Ooh, man that would be super uncool dude. Going over my head to ask Chuck. Let's ask him.</p>
<p class="action">Raymond slides the breakout room door open.</p>
<p class="speaker">RAYMOND</p>
<p class="dialogue">Hey, Chuck?</p>
<p class="speaker">CHuck (O.S.)</p>
<p class="dialogue">Yeah, Raymond?</p>
<p class="speaker">RAYMOND</p>
<p class="dialogue">If Aisha went over my head to ask you something would that be super uncool?</p>

<p class="dialogue">Yeah that would be super uncool dude.</p>
<p class="speaker">RAYMOND</p>

<p class="dialogue">Ah okay. Sorry.</p>
<p class="speaker">RAYMOND</p>
<p class="dialogue">No problem. All good. You're doing a good job. Just keep doing what you're doing.</p>
<p class="action">Raymond gets up to leave again.</p>
<p class="speaker">RAYMOND</p>
<p class="dialogue">Oh actually, while I have you. Wiener-Appetit is having trouble with their API integration and asked for on-site help. So, would you mind doing the team a real solid and jumping over there to meet with them?</p>
<p class="speaker">AISHA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Isn't Wiener-Appetit that ultra-conservative Christian fast food chain?</p>
<p class="speaker">RAYMOND</p>
<p class="dialogue">Yeah, that's the one!</p>
<p class="speaker">AISHA</p>
<p class="dialogue">I don't know if I really feel comfortable...</p>
<p class="speaker">RAYMOND</p>
<p class="dialogue">Hey, you're getting to travel for work, dude. That's pretty great. There are thousands of people from the COVID days that would kill for that opportunity. Plus doing shit like this could really add up to something.</p>

<p class="action">Mrs. Martinez opens the door brandishing a large keychain. She stomps toward Caroline.</p>

<p class="dialogue">Who's that, sugar?</p>
<p class="speaker">MRS. MARTINEZ</p>
<p class="dialogue">This is serious. Do you have the money or not. If you don't pay your rent, I'm throwing you out.</p>

<p class="dialogue">Where's the rent?</p>
<p class="speaker">MRS. BEAUREGARD</p>
<p class="dialogue">I thought that you were getting acting money. Didn't you get a part in that one horror movie that you and I both know I will never see because of my fear of characters making unrealistic decisions?</p>
<p class="speaker">CAROLINE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Mom, I...</p>
<p class="speaker">MRS. MARTINEZ</p>
<p class="dialogue">Your daughter has been lying to you Mrs. Beauregard. She doesn't have a roll in any movie.</p>
<p class="speaker">MRS. BEAUREGARD</p>
<p class="dialogue">Oh my stars, that just breaks my poor little heart. How could you do this to me, Caroline.</p>
<p class="speaker">CAROLINE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Mom, I'm working really hard.</p>
<p class="speaker">MRS. MARTINEZ</p>
<p class="dialogue">Ha! She's been spending all day trying to become a social media influencer.</p>
<p class="speaker">CAROLINE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Hey, you gave me that suggestion.</p>
<p class="speaker">MRS. MARTINEZ</p>
<p class="dialogue">I also gave you the suggestion of working at the Olive Garden, but apparently Social Media Influencer was what you picked as your side-gig. Look, all I want is the rent money.</p>
<p class="speaker">MRS. BEAUREGARD</p>
<p class="dialogue">Oh I'm so sorry, you had to go through all this Mrs. Martinez over my little Caroline. I'll tell you what, I'll pay for the missing rent.</p>
<p class="action">Caroline lets out a sigh of relief</p>
<p class="speaker">MRS. BEAUREGARD</p>
<p class="dialogue">Then I'm paying for the first plane ticket for you to come back to Roswell, young lady.</p>
<p class="speaker">CAROLINE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Mom! No! Don't make me leave LA.</p>
<p class="speaker">MRS. BEAUREGARD</p>
<p class="dialogue">You obviously can't handle it. No daughter of mine is going to keep lying about money.</p>
<p class="speaker">CAROLINE</p>
<p class="dialogue">I have to be in LA. It's where Hollywood is. It's where the actresses are.</p>
<p class="speaker">MRS. BEAUREGARD</p>
<p class="dialogue">Well, unless you find some way to make money it's right back home with you Miss Missy.</p>
<p class="speaker">CAROLINE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Mom, I'm twenty-five.</p>
<p class="speaker">MRS. BEAUREGARD</p>
<p class="dialogue">Then I would expect you to act like it... Well, Mrs. Martinez it was lovely getting to know you. If I ever find myself in the city of Los Angeles I'll be sure to make your acquaintance.</p>
<p class="speaker">MRS. MARTINEZ</p>
<p class="dialogue">That would be lovely.</p>
<p class="speaker">MRS. BEAUREGARD</p>
<p class="dialogue">I'll be sure to get your number from Caroline. Bye bye now!</p>
<p class="action">The phone hangs up.</p>
<p class="speaker">CAROLINE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Please don't make make me leave LA. My future is in Hollywood not Roswell.</p>
<p class="speaker">MRS. MARTINEZ</p>
<p class="dialogue">I see why you are so scared. Roswell is where the aliens are right?</p>
<p class="speaker">CAROLINE</p>
<p class="dialogue">No worse. It's a suburb of Atlanta. There aren't even aliens. Just a bunch of middle-aged white people. Okay, the social media influencer thing obviously isn't working. What else could I do?</p>
<p class="speaker">MRS. MARTINEZ</p>
<p class="dialogue">You could take some responsibility and get a job in retail.</p>
<p class="speaker">CAROLINE</p>
<p class="dialogue">That's hardly an option. Give me something serious.</p>
<p class="action">Mrs. Martinez rolls her eyes.</p>
<p class="speaker">MRS. MARTINEZ</p>
<p class="dialogue">You could make an app. I hear Kylie Jenner made a lot of money on hers.</p>
<p class="speaker">CAROLINE</p>
<p class="dialogue">I don't know how to program. Boring. Next.</p>
<p class="speaker">MRS. MARTINEZ</p>
<p class="dialogue">You could be in a sex scandal.</p>
<p class="speaker">CAROLINE</p>
<p class="dialogue">I wish, but do you know how hard it is getting successfully caught in a sex scandal.</p>
<p class="speaker">MRS. MARTINEZ</p>
<p class="dialogue">I don't even know why I'm giving you suggestions. Everything's good for me. The rent will be paid and you won't be a problem anymore. Plus you should be excited. You have free rent back in Atlanta.</p>
<p class="action">Caroline lays back on her bed.</p>
<p class="speaker">CAROLINE</p>
<p class="dialogue">I don't think anyone would be excited about going to Atlanta.</p>
EXT. AIRPORT - day
Chadwick's excited face is plastered to the window of an airplane as it taxis to its gate.
INT. AIRPORT TERMINAL - day
Chadwick steps out of the jet bridge into the terminal with excitement. The camera pans to mimic the stereotypical scene of someone stepping off a bus into a new city.
Cindy follows behind him with a groggy look on her face.
<p class="speaker">CINDY</p>
Ah, it's Atlanta. How long do we have for our connecting flight, dear.
<p class="speaker">CHADWICK</p>
smiling
There is no connecting flight, honey. This is our final destination.
<p class="speaker">CINDY</p>
No no no no no. There must be some kind of mistake. No one actually goes to the city of Atlanta, they just connect in the airport to go to somewhere better.
<p class="speaker">CHADWICK</p>
Well, consider us trailblazers then, because today we venture outside of the terminal. This is the new city that Roger Hopkins & Burke is considering for a satellite office, and quite possibly our new home.
<p class="speaker">CINDY</p>
No, it can't be
She looks around the room, head spinning. Each sign she sees proves the provincial nature of Atlanta.
<p class="speaker">CINDY</p>
When you said we could be moving for business I thought you meant London or Hong Kong. Not... this. Okay, maybe this isn't happening. I did take enough Dramamine for a flight to Europe maybe this is just a nightmare.
Cindy closes her eyes tightly and opens them.
<p class="speaker">CHADWICK</p>
Nope, this is real. Come on honey I've been reading a lot about Atlanta and I think you'll love it.
They begin walking
<p class="speaker">CHADWICK</p>
There's just something so endearing about smaller cities. The people here are more real than new york.
They enter a people mover
Speaker
Welcome to the plane train.
<p class="speaker">CHADWICK</p>
See? Even the trains are polite.
INT. GROUND TRANSPORTATION AREA - day
<p class="speaker">CHADWICK</p>
I know you might be hesitant about it, but give it a chance, I promise you as soon as something disappoints, it's back to New York.
Chadwick and Cindy approach a attendant at a ground transportation desk.
<p class="speaker">CHADWICK</p>
Hello, we have a car booked for Chadwick Williams.
Attendant
Of course Mr. Williams. Just a moment... Oh I'm sorry, there's been a problem with your car. It'll be another 30 minutes, or if you're in a rush, the Metro Area Rapid Transit Authority is right down there.
<p class="speaker">CHADWICK</p>
I can't believe it...
<p class="speaker">CINDY</p>
Aw, what a disappointment. I'll go get tickets to JFK.
<p class="speaker">CHADWICK</p>
...Their metro goes directly to the airport!
INT. AIRPORT TERMINAL - day
Caroline talks on her phone with an annoyed expression.
<p class="speaker">CAROLINE</p>
Yeah I just landed.
MRS. BEAUREGARD (V.O.)
Oh that's wonderful sweety. Just get on the train and I'll pick you up at North Springs. There's so much to show you. You're going to love Roswell, ya know it's more hip than you might remember. There's this new ice-cream place, but the ice-cream is for dogs not people. It's so funny.
Caroline rolls her eyes. She notices a group of people wearing startup hoodies pass her.
<p class="speaker">CAROLINE</p>
To herself
Startup hoodies...
She turns around and sees the group emerging from a gate displaying "Arrival from San Francisco"
<p class="speaker">CAROLINE</p>
Build an app, eh?
MRS. BEAUREGARD (V.O.)
What was that honey?
<p class="speaker">CAROLINE</p>
Everything I said was a lie, I didn't actually land. My flight was delayed I'm still in LA.
MRS. BEAUREGARD
What?
<p class="speaker">CAROLINE</p>
I'd love to continue this conversation but I'm on the plane now and we're taking off. Oh no, we're losing reception. *static*
Caroline hangs up her phone.
Aisha steps off the jetway and takes an unenthusiastic look around. She jumps when Caroline pops out of nowhere to greet her in a very thick southern accent.
<p class="speaker">CAROLINE</p>
Well hi there, young lady. How are you on this fine day?
<p class="speaker">AISHA</p>
Um, hi. I'm good.
<p class="speaker">CAROLINE</p>
Oh where are my manners, my name's Caroline. Are you new to the city?
<p class="speaker">AISHA</p>
Uh, yeah I...
<p class="speaker">CAROLINE</p>
Bless my soul, where are you from?
<p class="speaker">AISHA</p>
San Franc...
<p class="speaker">CAROLINE</p>
San Francisco, oh you don't say. Y'all are really good at computers over there right?
<p class="speaker">AISHA</p>
Yeah, I guess.
<p class="speaker">CAROLINE</p>
So, you must be really good at computers. You're one of those... software engineers.
<p class="speaker">AISHA</p>
I... I yeah.
Caroline looks away from Aisha and smirks to herself.
<p class="speaker">AISHA</p>
Well, it was nice meeting you.
<p class="speaker">CAROLINE</p>
Wait, certainly you want a guide to help you find your way.
<p class="speaker">AISHA</p>
I think I just follow the signs to baggage claim.
<p class="speaker">CAROLINE</p>
Oh nonsense, it's a very big airport. Very confusing. Where would my southern hospitality be if I didn't show you the way to... where is it you're going?
<p class="speaker">AISHA</p>
The Wiener-Appatite headquarters.
<p class="speaker">CAROLINE</p>
Oh my stars, I was going there too.
<p class="speaker">AISHA</p>
You were going to the Wiener-Appatite headquarters?
<p class="speaker">CAROLINE</p>
Or like around there, you know. Whatever. Come. I'll be your guide.
Caroline pulls Aisha along.
<p class="speaker">AISHA</p>
Okay. So are you from Atlanta or something?
<p class="speaker">CAROLINE</p>
Just about. I'm from a small town called Roswell.
<p class="speaker">AISHA</p>
Oh. Is that where the aliens are?
<p class="speaker">CAROLINE</p>
No, why does... nevermind. Follow me!
EXT. PEACHTREE CENTER - day
Chadwick and Cindy exit Peachtree center station. In front of them is the Westin.
<p class="speaker">CHADWICK</p>
There it is, Cindy, our home for the next couple of days, the Westin Peachtree Plaza. I've been reading all about it. Did you know when it opened, it was the tallest hotel in the world.
<p class="speaker">CINDY</p>
sarcastically
Great, it's a giant syringe.
<p class="speaker">CHADWICK</p>
Almost all of downtown Atlanta was designed by one guy, John Portman. Inspiring architecture, isn't it?
<p class="speaker">CINDY</p>
Who are you? You live in New York. You know this isn't inspiring architecture.
<p class="speaker">CHADWICK</p>
Look, you gotta see things through the eyes of a folksy Atlantan. Life's more exciting that way. Like here, apparently there are free chicken wings just left lying around everywhere. That's pretty great right?
Aisha and Caroline exit the subway station.
<p class="speaker">CAROLINE</p>
And we made it. Look at that, you couldn't have done it without me.
<p class="speaker">AISHA</p>
Yeah, I never knew the way to the city would feel so much like we were going in circles.
<p class="speaker">CAROLINE</p>
Yeah, but we were definitely no going in circles. The route is just so complex that only an Atlanta native like me can show you the way.
Chadwick and Cindy continue to talk nearby.
<p class="speaker">CHADWICK</p>
Let's just enjoy our time here. I just want to pretend I'm not a multi-millionare New York lawyer.
Caroline pivots her head in Chadwick's direction.
<p class="speaker">CHADWICK</p>
So let's enjoy a new city.
<p class="speaker">CAROLINE</p>
To Aisha
So, the Weiner-Appatite headquarters is right down there, and this is where I leave you.
<p class="speaker">AISHA</p>
Oh okay, well thanks, you were a lot of help. We should stay in touch.
<p class="speaker">CAROLINE</p>
Yeah yeah yeah. Just give me your number.
Caroline pushes her phone towards Aisha and looks over her shoulder to Chadwick walking away. She takes visible annoyance with the amount of time it takes Aisha to type in her number. Finally Aisha hands back the phone.
<p class="speaker">CAROLINE</p>
hurredly
It was a real blessing meeting you. I hope to see you again, etcetera. Bye, bye.
Caroline hurries away after Chadwick.
Aisha walks up to one of the Peachtree Center towers. It looks identical to her workplace in San Francisco. She sighs and enters.
INT. WIENER - APPETITE LOBBY - day
The lobby is well decorated. A large photo of a stern, puritan-looking man is displayed next to an ad with chickens crudely painting the words "Eat more Wieners." Below that text is a small disclaimer reading "But in a wholesome Christian way, you know."
Aisha grimmaces at the images. She approaches the front desk.
Front desk Attendant
Hi, welcome to Wiener-Appetit where we didn't invent the Wiener we just invented the idea of putting it in a bun and now we serve our Lord and savior Jesus Christ by selling fast food. How can I help you?
<p class="speaker">AISHA</p>
Yeah, I'm here to help with the Foodlivery API integration.
FRONT DESK ATTENDANT
One moment please, I'll tell them that you've arrived.
Moments later CHANCE exits the elevator into the lobby. He's tall, muscular, and overall conventionally handsome. He approaches Aisha and gives her a warm smile.
Chance
You must be Aisha. I'm Chance.
<p class="speaker">AISHA</p>
Hi... Chance.
CHANCE
Thank you so much for coming. You can't imagine how much of a help you'll be. Shall we get started.
Aisha smiles back at Chance.
<p class="speaker">AISHA</p>
Okay.
INT. WIENER - APPETIT OFFICE - day
Aisha and Chance sit at a desk looking at the same computer.
<p class="speaker">AISHA</p>
And now the request is getting processed.
CHANCE
Ah that makes sense. Hey thanks for that.
They smile at each other.
CHANCE
Anyway, looks like that's it for the day. Where are you staying?
<p class="speaker">AISHA</p>
The Westin
CHANCE
Oh! My church is on the way there. I'm leading a Wednesday bible study. I could walk you over.
<p class="speaker">AISHA</p>
Yeah, sure.
EXT. ATLANTA STREET - day
Aisha and Chance slowly walk down the sidewalk.
<p class="speaker">AISHA</p>
...And that's when I started working for Foodlivery.
CHANCE
Wow. I really envy you. You seem to know exactly what you wanted to do in life. Even since high school.
<p class="speaker">AISHA</p>
unsure
Uh yeah. Sure, I guess you could say that.
CHANCE
It was never that way for me. I didn't know what I was going to do after graduating. But one day I decided to leave Clevland, and become a carpetbagger.
<p class="speaker">AISHA</p>
Carpetbagger?
CHANCE
Oh it's a term for someone who moved to the south from the north. Atlanta's basically a city of transplants. So, once I moved, I landed with Wiener-Appetit. I may not have a degree, but this is an opportunity to learn how to code.
<p class="speaker">AISHA</p>
So, you're just working there as a learning opportunity.
CHANCE
Sure! It's a good industry to get into especially here. Atlanta is the tech capital of the south. Unless you count Austin, but I'm pretty sure no one considers Texas a part of the south.
<p class="speaker">AISHA</p>
But, doesn't working for Wiener-Appetit make you feel uncomfortable. I heard the founder had a lodge where he would hunt atheists for sport.
CHANCE
That's true. But, the founder's not around anymore, and thanks to people like me the culture's changing. It's more accepting. It's kinda like this city. Atlanta has had a troubling history, and parts of it still are troubling, but that's why people who care can make a big difference here.
<p class="speaker">AISHA</p>
Huh.
They arrive outside a church.
CHANCE
Well, this is me. I'll see you tomorrow.
Aisha smiles and waves at him as he walks away. Caroline startles her as she appears out of nowhere.
<p class="speaker">CAROLINE</p>
I see the way you're looking at him.
<p class="speaker">AISHA</p>
I what, where did you come from?
<p class="speaker">CAROLINE</p>
Sorry to burst your bubble, but he's gay.
<p class="speaker">AISHA</p>
What, but the church.
Caroline gives Aisha a knowing look, and Aisha turns to inspect the church. It's sign has a pride flag with the words, "Please come in, we're not like those OTHER churches."
<p class="speaker">CAROLINE</p>
You act like you've never seen a gay church before.
<p class="speaker">AISHA</p>
Well, sure but just in SF.
<p class="speaker">CAROLINE</p>
We've got them here too. Ya know Atlanta is the gay capital of the south. Unless you count Orlando, but I'm pretty sure no one considers Florida a part of the south. Now come on, there's someone I want you to meet.
<p class="speaker">AISHA</p>
Is this a part of the southern hospitality thing?
<p class="speaker">CAROLINE</p>
Oh yeah. Yeah, it's a part of that.
INT. WESTIN LOBBY - day
Caroline directs Aisha to Chadwick and Cindy sitting at one of the couches. Chadwick stands to greet them, but Cindy remains seated, averting an annoyed gaze.
<p class="speaker">CAROLINE</p>
Aisha, this is Chadwick and his wife, he's new to Atlanta too. Chadwick, Aisha.
<p class="speaker">CHADWICK</p>
To Aisha
Ah so has Caroline roped you into meeting people too? I hear it's a southern hospitality thing.
<p class="speaker">AISHA</p>
So I'm told. I've actually been pleasantly surprised by all the hospitality I've been getting. It's totally not what I expected.
<p class="speaker">CAROLINE</p>
Now that I have you to together, let me give you my pitch.
The smile vanishes from Aisha's face.
<p class="speaker">AISHA</p>
A what?
Chadwick
Ooh a pitch! Exciting! Go ahead.
<p class="speaker">CAROLINE</p>
Our meeting can only be due to fate. How else could Aisha, a software engineer, Chadwick, and millionaire lawyer, and me, a successful social media influencer come together? The universe is calling saying that we need to build an app. We could be a team!
<p class="speaker">AISHA</p>
Wait, you want us to make an app?
<p class="speaker">CHADWICK</p>
I like the hustle. Do you hear that, Cindy, not a day in and I've already fielded a pitch for a tech product! That's just magic of this city!
<p class="speaker">CINDY</p>
Seriously, how could you be this excited? I don't know you anymore.
<p class="speaker">CHADWICK</p>
Don't mind her. It takes some people a little more time to warm up to the magic. Who would've thought. I came to this town with nothing to my name except a law degree from Cornell, a lovely wife, BAR accreditation, a membership to many elite societies, a job at a major Manhattan law firm, and 11.3 million dollars in liquid assets, oh and this antique perian carpet I keep in this bag here. And look at me now!
<p class="speaker">AISHA</p>
So that's it huh? You weren't just being nice and hospitable? You just wanted to make an app?
<p class="speaker">CAROLINE</p>
Well, I mean I always want to be hospitable, but yes, I'd also like to build an app.
<p class="speaker">AISHA</p>
Unbelievable. And here I thought for one second that I found a place with people who are different. Who are wholesome. Turns out you're just as inwardly focused as everyone else. Now, if you'll excuse me, I have to call into a meeting with my real team.
Aisha leaves.
<p class="speaker">CHADWICK</p>
Guess she hasn't warmed up to the magic yet either.
INT. HOTEL ROOM - day
Aisha enters the room and opens her laptop. She checks the clock: 5:56. She opens her web conferencing software and can hear the voice of her teammates back in San Francisco.
Raymond (V.O.)
Yeah I don't know, dude. She was asking about working for the Food Desert Initiative earlier.
Teammate (V.O.)
So then why not let her? I know Martha's been looking for some more developers.
<p class="speaker">RAYMOND</p> (V.O.)
Yeah, Martha told me that too. It's just that I need her.
Aisha smiles as she listens in.
<p class="speaker">RAYMOND</p> (V.O.)
Between you and me, man, Aisha's a perfect gift. Not only is she a woman, but she's black. That's two levels of diversity. I can't let her leave my team. Having her makes me look really good.
Aisha's face transitions to one of horror.
<p class="speaker">RAYMOND</p> (V.O.)
Whelp it's 3, let's go ahead an open the meeting... Whatup everyone?
INT. HOTEL BAR - Dusk
Aisha sits down at the bar and addresses the bartender.
<p class="speaker">AISHA</p>
Just give me... whatever.
<p class="speaker">CHADWICK</p>
Tough day, huh? Me too.
Chadwick has been sitting next to Aisha.
<p class="speaker">AISHA</p>
Oh it's you, Chadward right?
<p class="speaker">CHADWICK</p>
Chadwick, yeah.
<p class="speaker">AISHA</p>
Hey, I'm sorry for storming out like that, it had nothing to do with you. I just met you.
<p class="speaker">CHADWICK</p>
No it's not that. I've been trying to be excited about Atlanta for my wife, Cindy, but she is just not having any of it.
Chadwick gestures to a booth in the bar where his wife sits with a perturbed disposition.
<p class="speaker">AISHA</p>
Do you mind if I ask you something?
<p class="speaker">CHADWICK</p>
Go ahead.
<p class="speaker">AISHA</p>
Why do you like Atlanta, anyways. What do you see in this city?
<p class="speaker">CHADWICK</p>
You know, it's not even the city. I mean don't get me wrong, it's a pretty good place for a finance lawyer. After all, Atlanta is the banking capital of the south. Unless you count Charlotte, but I'm pretty sure people don't consider North Carolina part of the south.
<p class="speaker">AISHA</p>
What DOES count as part of the south then?
<p class="speaker">CHADWICK</p>
Back in Manhattan, sure I was a successful lawyer. I had everything I dreamed of, but I was a part of a set. I wasn't good enough to stand out as extraordinary. But, Atlanta represents a new start for me. Here I can be unique. Like this building. Sure it looks like a syringe, and in New York it probably wouldn't be anything special, but here it means something. Here, I can mean something more.
<p class="speaker">AISHA</p>
People who care can make a big difference here...
<p class="speaker">CHADWICK</p>
Yep, this building sure is unique. On an unrelated note, have you ever been to the General Motors headquarters in Detroit? I've always wanted to go but I've never seen it.
<p class="speaker">AISHA</p>
I... I don't think I have.
<p class="speaker">CHADWICK</p>
Dang it. Oh well, so what about you? What's got you down?
<p class="speaker">AISHA</p>
I just found out that my boss isn't promoting me because he wants to keep me on his team for diversity cred.
<p class="speaker">CHADWICK</p>
Ouch. You should definitely report that to upper management.
<p class="speaker">AISHA</p>
Something tells me that would be considered "uncool." I wanted to make an impact. Do something more than my mundane work. I'm just tired, of people taking advantage of me. First Charoline, now this.
<p class="speaker">CHADWICK</p>
At least Caroline wanted you because she had respect for your skill.
<p class="speaker">AISHA</p>
Yeah that's true. Maybe I was a little harsh to her. She's just trying to get something going. I can't fault her from that.
Caroline pops out of nowhere and hugs Aisha. Aisha jumps.
<p class="speaker">CAROLINE</p>
Apology accepted!
<p class="speaker">AISHA</p>
What! Where?
<p class="speaker">CAROLINE</p>
Oh I'm so sorry I didn't reveal my true intentions. The truth is, you're really cool, and I want to build something with you.
<p class="speaker">AISHA</p>
Hold on, I didn't agree to do anything.
<p class="speaker">CAROLINE</p>
You said yourself that you want to make a bigger impact than your current job. Make an impact with us!
<p class="speaker">AISHA</p>
I... you know what? Okay. But, I get to work on my terms.
<p class="speaker">CAROLINE</p>
Of course.
<p class="speaker">AISHA</p>
We're going to do something that helps people.
<p class="speaker">CAROLINE</p>
You're smart, you have a heart of gold! What's not to love.
Caroline hugs Aisha again.
<p class="speaker">CHADWICK</p>
I'm so glad that the funding for this moment was provided by me.
A notification sounds on his phone. He opens it and his smile increases.
<p class="speaker">CHADWICK</p>
Good news! My trip's been extended from three days. I don't need to go back to New York for another month!
<p class="speaker">CAROLINE</p>
And I don't need to go back to Roswell.
<p class="speaker">CHADWICK</p>
concerned
Yeah, don't go back to Roswell. That's where the aliens are right?
<p class="speaker">CAROLINE</p>
...yes. That's where the aliens are.
The group continues to talk as the camera zooms away.
EPIC VOICE
And so the legend of Atlanta formed another group of stalwart heroes. But for every hero, there is a villain. A challenge to the group's Atlantasy.
The camera zooms into Cindy's enraged expression as ominous music plays.
