  <h1>MonstroCities</h1>
  <p>A day after I watched "Godzilla vs Kong" I was inspired to write this first scene of a monster movie</p>
  <p >I realized monster movies are incredibly dumb, but also incredibly fun. So, I wanted to write my own. But, one of the successes of Godzilla vs Kong was that these were two characters that everyone recognized. How was I going to create battling monsters that everyone recognized when I didn't own the rights to anything? I figured I should choose something in the public domain. My first thought was Greek Gods as monsters, but the problem with that is Greek Gods have to much agency to be monsters. You need to have a feeling that the monsters can't be reasoned with. So, then I thought maybe they could be zombie Greek Gods, but that's just too convoluted at that point.</p>
  <p>Then it dawned on me. A while ago I saw Mortal Engines and was disappointed that it wasn't a movie about cities fighting each other. I thought that would be a cool stupid movie, but it never occurred to me to make the cities monster mechs! It's great because it combines a monster movie with iconic buildings (which often get destroyed in monster movies so why not have a movie where iconic buildings fight each other). So I started writing.</p>
  <p>And yes I know that the "House Majority Leader" is called the "Speaker of the House." I'm just to lazy to change it. And I also know that the House of Representatives chamber isn't in the Capitol Dome. That's creative liscense.</p>

<p class="scene">EXT. CityScape - day</p>
<p class="action">Stock footage of people bustling around a city plays.</p>
<p class="speaker">Christopher (V.O.)</p>
<p class="dialogue">A wise man once said, "A city is like an organism. It has a rhythm, a beating heart and all of its people contribute to one whole." Of course, when those words were originally said, they were said metaphorically, it wasn't until the cataclysm that they would become the literal truth.</p>
<p class="scene">EXT. EARTH - day</p>
<p class="action">All the land on earth begins to brown and die.</p>
<p class="speaker">CHRISTOPHER (V.O.)</p>
<p class="dialogue">No one saw it coming. Without warning, the earth simply stopped providing all natural resources. Trees withered and turned to ash, crop fields became infertile, mines suddenly lost all their precious resources, even stone became soft and impossible to use in construction. We were left only with what we had constructed ourselves. Mother Earth had abandoned us.</p>
<p class="action">A montage of dystopian scenes play. People rioting, decaying cities, scientists frantically looking for a solution.</p>
<p class="speaker">CHRISTOPHER (V.O.)</p>
<p class="dialogue">Some say that it was final retribution for all the polluting that we did, others say that it was an act of God. The world's top scientists searched for a cause, but found none. We had to face the reality that there was no way to build anything new. We were stuck with what we had or what we could take from others.</p>
<p class="scene">INT. OVAL OFFICE - day</p>
<p class="action">President Walden sits at the resolute desk. A group of military advisors rush into the office.</p>
<p class="speaker">Advisor</p>
<p class="dialogue">Mister President, new intelligence about Congress.</p>
<p class="speaker">President Walden</p>
<p class="dialogue">And?</p>
<p class="speaker">ADVISOR</p>
<p class="dialogue">You were right, sir. They've been plotting against you all along. They're preparing to take the White Houses resources for their own.</p>
<p class="speaker">PRESIDENT WALDEN</p>
<p class="dialogue">How much time do we have?</p>
<p class="action">A low rumble shakes the room.</p>
<p class="speaker">ADVISOR</p>
<p class="dialogue">We're out of time.</p>
<p class="action">President Walden looks out the window.</p>
<p class="speaker">EXT. NATIONAL MALL - day</p>
<p class="action">The rumbling intensifies and the Capitol building slowly lifts off its foundation revealing heavy tank treads beneath it. </p>
<p class="scene">INT. HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES - day</p>
<p class="action">We zoom into the Capitol rotunda to see the House of Representatives chamber arranged like the bridge of a starship.</p>
<p class="speaker">House Majority Leader</p>
<p class="dialogue">Whoever said Congress couldn't work together never anticipated the cataclysm.</p>
<p class="parenthetical">Yelling</p>
<p class="dialogue">Forward!</p>
<p class="action">A few representatives pull some levers on their console.</p>
<p class="scene">EXT. NATIONAL MALL - day</p>
<p class="action">Machinery buzzes and the massive treads begin to turn as the Capitol building slowly moves down the national mall towards the white house.</p>
<p class="scene">INT. OVAL OFFICE - day</p>
<p class="speaker">ADVISOR</p>
<p class="dialogue">What do we do Mister President?</p>
<p class="action">President Walden stares at a large red button on the Resolute Desk.</p>
<p class="scene">EXT. NATIONAL MALL - Day</p>
<p class="action">The Capitol building picks up speed and rounds a corner, knocking over the Washington Monument. It is almost upon the White House.</p>
<p class="scene">INT. HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES - day</p>
<p class="speaker">HOUSE MAJORITY LEADER</p>
<p class="action">Ready the chamber smashers!</p>
<p class="scene">EXT. NATIONAL MALL - day</p>
<p class="action">The wings of the capitol building begin to bend and become two massive robot arms with the Senate and House of Representatives Chambers as massive hammers. They position the arms over the White House and prepare to smash.</p>
<p class="scene">INT. OVAL OFFICE - Day</p>
<p class="action">President Walden presses the button, and the entire office rearranges into a command center with President Walden at the helm. He wears gloves connected to wires.</p>
<p class="scene">EXT. NATIONAL MALL - day</p>
<p class="action">The Capitol building brings down the hammer and a cloud of dust explodes, blocking the field of view. The House Majority Leader smirks sadistically, but the dust clears revealing that the White house has moved and stands on two legs formed from the east and west wing.</p>
<p class="scene">INT. OVAL OFFICE - day</p>
<p class="action">President Walden makes a gesture with his hands, moving the robotic White House.</p>
<p class="scene">EXT. NATIONAL MALL - day</p>
<p class="action">The White House jumps into a side-kick that lands square on the Capitol dome, driving the building back several hundred feet and leaving a canyon of destruction in the Ellipse.</p>
<p class="scene">INT. OVAL OFFICE - day</p>
<p class="action">President Walden smiles to himself.</p>
<p class="speaker">PRESIDENT WALDEN</p>
<p class="action">You just got vetoed.</p>
<p class="scene">EXT. NATIONAL MALL - day</p>
<p class="action">More agile than the Capitol Building, the White House is able to maneuver around it with ease, dodging swings from the two hammers. </p>
<p class="action">Eventually one of the hammers connects and the White House is knocked aside causing it to skid through the US Department of Commerce. President Walden has fallen over, hurt.</p>
<p class="action">The Capitol building begins to creep towards the White House.</p>
<p class="scene">INT. HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES - day</p>
<p class="speaker">HOUSE MAJORITY LEADER</p>
<p class="dialogue">Oh, I'm sorry Mister President but a two thirds majority overturns a veto. So, our victory is law.</p>
<p class="scene">EXT. NATIONAL MALL - day</p>
<p class="action">The Capitol building approaches the White House and once again prepares to smash it.</p>
<p class="action">A marble statue slams into the Capitol dome from the other side. Standing behind it is a quadrupedal Supreme Court.</p>
<p class="scene">INT. SUPREME COURT - day</p>
<p class="action">Each Supreme Court Justice is sat at their desk with hands on controls.</p>
<p class="speaker">Chief Justice</p>
<p class="dialogue">Not if we declare that law unconstitutional.</p>
<p class="scene">EXT. NATIONAL MALL - day</p>
<p class="action">The Capitol Building wheels around and begins to to face the Supreme Court.</p>
<p class="action">President Walden brings to White House to a sitting position. He examines the damage to the building. It is extensive. Though he notices one place where the rubble of the US Department of Commerce has patched one of the gashes. He controls the mech to place more of the rubble, repairing the White House even more.</p>
<p class="action">The Capitol Building and the Supreme Court continue to fight. The Supreme Court jumps around like a cat while the Capitol building tears up the national mall trying to land a hit.</p>
<p class="action">It corners the Supreme Court near the Lincoln Memorial when the White House intervenes, deflecting its blow. The White House is now three times its original size having augmented itself with US Department of Commerce and the Ronald Reagan building. It now has arms with extended reach.</p>
<p class="scene">INT. HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES - Day</p>
<p class="speaker">HOUSE MAJORITY LEADER</p>
<p class="dialogue">Damn, that Presidential Overreach!</p>
<p class="scene">EXT. NATIONAL MALL - day</p>
<p class="action">The three continue to battle, but while the White House and Supreme court are able to land a few blows, they simply are not able to damage the Capitol building to the same degree. The Capitol building smashes pieces off each of its opponents.</p>
<p class="action">With one sweep it knocks both opponents over the reflecting pool back to the place where the Washington Monument once stood. The Capitol Building begins to crawl towards where they landed.</p>
<p class="scene">INT. OVAL OFFICE - Day</p>
<p class="speaker">PRESIDENT WALDEN</p>
<p class="dialogue">They're too big. There's no way we can defeat them.</p>
<p class="action">He looks out to window to see a similarly damaged Supreme Court. </p>
<p class="speaker">PRESIDENT WALDEN</p>
<p class="dialogue">Unless...</p>
<p class="scene">EXT. NATIONAL MALL - day</p>
<p class="action">President Walden maneuvers the White House over the Supreme Court. It rips a chunk away from it placing the iconic columned front of the Supreme court directly below the central part of the White House.</p>
<p class="scene">INT. SUPREME COURT - day</p>
<p class="speaker">CHIEF JUSTICE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Mister President, what are you doing?</p>
<p class="scene">INT. OVAL OFFICE - day</p>
<p class="speker">PRESIDENT WALDEN</p>
<p class="dialogue">I am sorry my friends. It's the only way we can defeat them.</p>
<p class="scene">EXT. NATIONAL MALL - day</p>
<p class="action">The White House continues to strip away parts of the Supreme Court to add to itself. Meanwhile the Capitol Building grows nearer.</p>
<p class="scene">INT. HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES - day</p>
<p class="speaker">HOUSE MAJORITY LEADER</p>
<p class="dialogue">Any last words before your impeachment?</p>
<p class="scene">INT. OVAL OFFICE - day</p>
<p class="speaker">PRESIDENT WALDEN</p>
<p class="dialogue">When I'm done with you, you'll be singing hail to the chief.</p>
<p class="scene">EXT. NATIONAL MALL - day</p>
<p class="action">The White House turns and stands, showing that with the addition of the Supreme Court, it is twice the size of the Capitol Building. It brandishes the Washington Monument in one hand as a sword and plunges the monument into the top of the Capitol dome. The Capitol's machinery sputters then goes silent.</p>
<p class="scene">INT. OVAL OFFICE - day</p>
<p class="action">President Walden gives a sigh of relief, but then slowly begins to laugh until it grows into a maniacal cackle. </p>
<p class="scene">EXT. NATIONAL MALL - Dusk</p>
<p class="action">The White House picks up the Capitol dome and add it to its body.</p>
<p class="speaker">CHRISTOPHER (V.O.)</p>
<p class="dialogue">That's how it began. The game had changed. Money or power didn't matter anymore. The only rule was consume or be consumed. Those who didn't adapt were sitting ducks.</p>
<p class="action">The White House, now 10 times its size tears into some DC bureaucratic offices to add to its body. People scream from the windows.</p>
<p class="scene">EXT. VIRGINIA - night</p>
<p class="action">The Pentagon - lifted on thousands of wheels - speeds along pursued by a now monstrous bipedal being with the White house as its head, the Supreme Court as its neck, and the Capitol Building - with the Washington Monument still stuck in it - as its chest.</p>
<p class="speaker">CHRISTOPHER (V.O.)</p>
<p class="dialogue">Until eventually, some mechs got big enough to consume entire buildings at a time, and then it didn't matter if you had adapted. The only thing that mattered was size.</p>
<p class="action">The monster catches the Pentagon and adds it as its stomach. The city of Washington DC stands at its full height and roars.</p>
<p class="scene">INT. MACHINE ROOMS - Night</p>
<p class="action">The members of Congress and the Supreme Court do hard labor in a grungy machine room made of broken marble.</p>
<p class="speaker">CHRISTOPHER (V.O.)</p>
<p class="dialogue">Those who were consumed were forced to do hard labor to keep the the machines running. Like blood cells keeping a body alive. But the brain of that body, was a special position reserved for the victor.</p>
<p class="scene">INT. OVAL OFFICE - Night</p>
<p class="action">President Walden looks down onto a destroyed DC landscape smiling evily. His hair is now askew and he has a crazed look in his eye.</p>
<p class="speaker">CHRISTOPHER (V.O.)</p>
<p class="dialogue">But there wasn't only one predator.</p>
<p class="action">On the horizon the silhouette of a bird-shaped giant flashes in the fog.</p>
<p class="speaker">PRESIDENT WALDEN</p>
<p class="dialogue">Baltimore.</p>
<p class="action">The mist clears and an Oriole shaped mech stands before DC made of Baltimore icons. Its head is Mr. Trash Wheel, and he's angry.</p>
<p class="speaker">CHRISTOPHER (V.O.)</p>
<p class="dialogue">The age of cities was over. The age of Monstro-Cities had begun.</p>
<p class="scene">EXT. CHESAPEAKE - night</p>
<p class="action">Washington DC and Baltimore charge toward each other ready to fight.</p>
