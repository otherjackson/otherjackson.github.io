  <h1>Filling out the Team (2021-03-15 to 2021-03-24)</h1>
  <p>Lots of ups and downs this week.</p>

  <h2>2021-03-15</h2>
  <p>Okay, let's start with the Android deploy. I got it fixed and confirmed that everything is set up to dynamically push application updates without going through the play store. I also got the Apple deploy online, but I don't remember if I did that on the 15th or the 16th. Eventually, Apple didn't accept the app for two reasons: firstly they were having trouble logging in due to some bug I can't replicate. I need to look into that. But another reason is that they said they also need to have "Sign In With Apple", which is not compatiable with Solid. I think I got that reason waived, so hopefully once I fix the login bug, they'll be good to go.</p>
  <p>I also had the talk with Ali Partovi and Jenny Wang that day. I don't think it went the way I wanted. I should've done a better job building up a rapport but I think I was straight to business. But, the big thing they said before the end of the meeting was that it was cool and they like investing in technical founders, they'd just need to discuss if there's any commercial value. So, I really need to work harder on talking about commercial value. It's hard to get everything out in only 30 minutes, but that's my job to work on.</p>
  <p>I also had one interview that didn't show up.</p>
  <p>Overall, despite the bad meeting. I felt pretty good with the day, I got a lot done.</p>

  <h2>2021-03-16</h2>
  <p>I don't remember the other work on did on Tuesday. Maybe I should write it down the day of, but I did have a meeting with Mike Maples and Thiago</p>
  <p>Firstly, Thiago called and said that after meeting with the investor board, they weren't going to get involved at this time. He didn't question whether or not the product could get traction, but did question whether I could personally get the product traction. He said that I needed a more business-customer focused person to join the team. But, he did seem open in investing given that happened. I'll stay on the lookout for a potential founder like that, but I have an even higher requirement for business people joining than developers. I do not want O to go the way of Inrupt with a CEO that doesn't understand the vision yet holds the power.</p>
  <p>He explained the same concerns Ali had, but this time with a stress on the go-to-market strategy. He just doesn't see a way to get normal people involved beyond the Solid community. The meeting was only 30 minutes and a lot of that needed to be spent catching Mike up on all the things that happened and the content of the whitepaper. So, there wasn't a lot of time to explain the go-to-market strategy. This all just goes to show, that the go-to-market needs to be front and center when I present next.
  <p>I felt pretty down about it. At this point, two investors had backed out, and I really at least thought that Floodgate would invest. I always had Ali, but I didn't feel too confident that that one would go through.</p>
  <p>I really wish I had more time to get to know the investors. 30 minute meetings that keep getting pushed back gives so little opportunity. Maybe networking events would work, but that's not really happening in Covid. That's why I like working with Thiago. I know him.</p>

  <h2>2021-03-17</h2>
  <p>I had 4 interviews. The one that stood out was Godswill Okokon who is the founder of the React Native Nigeria group, though I haven't heard a response from him to move to level 2 yet, so I don't know where that's going.</p>
  <p>But, also today, Charlie texted me saying he'd be a yes for joining the team! This started to spark a bit of hope, so we scheduled a bit of time to talk over the weekend.</p>
  <p>I think I was tackling various bugs around Liqid chat, but I don't really remember which. I think the whole apple saga was still going on.</p>

  <h2>2021-03-18</h2>
  <p>On Thursday, it was time to reassess everything. With investors pulling out I needed to reckon with the reality that I wouldn't be able to have a team, even if Charlie wanted to join. So I began to draw out what a databrowser would look like if only I worked on it. So, I cut features until I was left with something that might function like the databrowser underneith, but it really nothing more than a twitter clone. There would be no dev tools and no React Native client. Just a web data browser, a global data index, an applet server, and some social applets. And even then, it would take months to complete everything.</p>
  <p>With the plan layed out, I had a decision to make. I could spend the next few months building the databrowser in order to prove the concept, but that would be ignoring the reasons I was turned down from investors. The thing to prove isn't getting the tech to work. It's going to market. It would be a waste of time to build the databrowser to test its marketability if I already had a product that was ready to go. If my hypothesis is true that you can ride on the media wave of Solid to promote a new product, then that's just as true for Liqid Chat as the databrowser. So, it would have to be nothing but Liqid Chat work until I could secure funding.</p>
  <p>I worked Star Jump a bit in the evening. I decided to jump to the "all is lost" maybe becuase I was feeling down haha.</p>

  <h2>2021-03-19</h2>
  <p>Friday was great! After a week of unfortunate findings, I feel like a see a path forward.</p>
  <p>I had originally planned to work on the Community Solid Server to get it ready to host chats as well. But, even that is a distraction from what I should be doing. Yes, it would be nicer to have a deployed version of CSS, but NSS with all its flaws, still works. The goal is to see how many people I can bring to Liqid Chat, and I think having a slightly faster server wouldn't be as big as working on promoting it.</p>
  <p>So, now I needed to go out of my comfort zone. I didn't spend Friday working on Tech, but a go to market plan based on a Social Media campaign. Right now, I have a decent social media following and a networking meeting, but it's not huge. Goal one needs to be building up a following and then directing it to Liqid Chat.</p>
  <p>From everything I've heard, video content gets the most interactions, so I'd need to make a video series. I also heard that YouTube shorts and TikTok videos were popular. So, I would need to make vertical videos of less than a minute. I am by no means a social media expert, and this could end up pretty cringey. It might not end up working, but if it does, then that's the first step in the go to market plan.</p>
  <p>I spent the day getting editing software and filming the first two episodes. I made a few mistakes, like the lighting wasn't great, and I think I needed to smile more, but it was a start. I took my inspiration from the short videos JJ Mccullough makes because I really enjoy his style.</p>
  <p>Later in the evening I talked to Jonathan about lessons learned and he said he could help sync me up with more investors. Jonathan is such a helpful friend. I'm so grateful he's here to guide me through the fundraising process.</p>
  
  <h2>2021-03-20</h2>
  <p>On Saturday, Ailin and I ran a few errands. First, we went to a thrift shop to sell clothes. Ailin got $60 for hers, but they didn't take any of my pants :(. I've had some pants since high school (They even have the "k-12" tag from Uniform Depot) and they just started to not fit, so I had to donate them rather than sell them.</p>
  <p>After that we had lunch as a burger place on NYU's campus, which was important because when I needed to use the bathroom later they were the place we returned because it's so hard to find a public bathroom in New York.</p>
  <p>We also went to the strand bookstore, and while there, I got a lot of ideas for a book reading applet. You could quote sentences and comment on them and you could also see comments on the chapter from people who haven't read the rest of the book, so it feels like you have community with people who are in the same place as you.</p>
  <p>After that we went to Warby Parker to get our glasses adjusted. The guy who did it was really impressive. All he needed to do was look at us and knew exactly how to adjust it.</p>
  <p>On our way to the next thing, we encountered a walk to bring awareness to Asian violence. This was spurred by the shooting that happened in the Atlanta suburbs early that week. I'd been keeping up to date with the guy lived so close to where I grew up.</p>
  <p>We went to Uniqlo to get new pants for me, and Ailin convinced me to break out of just black pants. We got some shorts with hexagons on them!</p>
  <p>Finally, we ended the day by getting Congee and streaming ALL of Wanda Vision.</p>
  <p>I'm glad I have Ailin. She's a very positive influence on my life and I feel like I'd be a lot more unhappy without her. She gives me the motivation to keep working at this startup.</p>

  <h2>2021-03-21</h2>
  <p>On Sunday I made and edited five more videos. I think that's basically it I realized that filming during the day rather than night provides better lighting.</p>
  
  <h2>2021-03-22</h2>
  <p>On Monday, I filmed 7 episodes and edited 5. I also released the first episode to 5 platforms: Twitter, YouTube, Instagram, LinkedIn and TikTok. Twitter is going about the same as my other tweets. A few likes, but I am getting a few more followers through it. Instagram is by far the worst with almost no-one looking at them. YouTube has a few views, but if what I know about the algorithm is correct, that's going to get better once it realizes I'm posting every day. TikTok is surprisingly strong with a couple hundred views, and I think LinkedIn is the most successful with hundreds of views and tens of likes.</p>
  <p>I've made enough videos to post every day for 14 days, so we'll see where we're at after that. If I have a good enough audience, I'll set up a funnel to bring them to Liqid.chat. I'll report every level of the funnel to diagnose how good this is at conversions.</p>
  
  <h2>2021-03-23</h2>
  <p>On Tuesday, after posting the next post, I completed editing the final two episodes, and fixed a problem LiqidChat Android was having with push notifications.</p>
  <p>I also sent a new slide deck to Jonathan that had a bio for both Charlie Wang and Philippe Kimura-Thollander on the Team page. This should do a lot to build confidence among investors. I've learned that it's hard to start as a single founder.</p>

  <h2>2021-03-24</h2>
  <p>Finally, today, I posted another post, and had two interviews. The first was a second round interview that wasn't qualified enough for the job, and the second was a talk with Hrishik Radhakrishan. I had reached out to him before with no response but I think the social media posts drew attention to my message so we met up. I think he'd be perfect for O. He has a security background and seems pretty excited about the product. I shared the whitepaper, and we'll see what he thinks.</p>
  <p>I might have spent too long writing this post today, so I should get back to work!</p>
