  <h1>Full time recruiting (2021-03-03 to 2021-03-09))</h1>

  <h2>2021-03-02</h2>
  <p>Last week I mentioned that I would have another conversation with Floodgate, this time with Arjun. I felt it went very well. He had a few questions prepared and I believe I handled each one of them. Spending time to think out the market and go-to-market plan was definitely worth it. We talked about timeline and he said that the investors would meet on Friday to discuss and I shared my timeline as well.</p>

  <h2>2021-03-03</h2>
  <p>Wednesday was the first day I made available for interviews with people from Angellist. I had four back-to-back meetings set up, a gap of a couple of hours, then three more.</p>
  <p>The Angellist people I met this day, weren't ready to go to the next level. Two didn't even show up to their scheduled interview, and one straight up told me that he didn't do any architecture design (points for honesty, but why did you apply to a senior software role if you can't design your own architecture?). One candidate had a background in blockchain tech, so that's a plus given they'll know what it's like to work in the decentralized space even if we're not going to be using blockchain. But, he was sketchy as hell. He was really pushy about getting another interview, asked a lot about the salary, and asked if everything could be paid in PayPal. Not really the greatest look, especially for a first interview. At this point, I was wondering if Angellist would ever give a quality candidate.</p>
  <p>I also talked with Titus again. I shared the progress on the funding, and he didn't say know to joining the company, but he didn't say yes. At this point, I'm wondering if he just doesn't want to say no because he's polite or if he still has some interest. I have another meeting with him on Tuesday and we'll figure that out.</p>
  <p>In the evening I talked to someone I knew from Yahoo, Arun Kumar. He seemed interested, but apparently he's currently making $300k at Microsoft, and I certainly can't match that! That would be most of the budget. I want to pay a fair salary, but I also need to keep the financial viability of the company in mind.</p>
  <p>The next conversation felt better and ended my day on a good note. I contacted Sharon Stratsianis. She was a former intern at Inrupt living in Australia. I never interacted with her much as Inrupt never flew her to the all-hands sessions and she was on a different team, but when I told her what I want to work on, she seemed overjoyed. She's been working with the old Databrowser for a while and would love to have a next-gen replacement. Living in Australia might make things hard, but she said that it might work out because she could wake up at 4am to be in sync with the eastern timezone and that would give her more time to spend with her kids in the afternoon. She also said that they were considering moving to the US after the pandemic anyway. She expressed that she might not be qualified for the job. I assured her that I reached out to her because she's one of the few people in the world who are familiar with Solid and that's valuable. We decided that she would do some research on some problems I hope to solve with the databrowser and then we'd sync up after that. What she delivered over the following week definitely assured me that she has the ability to hold her own in architectural conversations and would be a huge contributor to some of the specification related things we need to do. Later in the week she echoed the sentiment that she didn't feel like she's a good enough coder, and I assured her that that can be determined by an objective measure, so I gave her the same techincal interview prompts I'd been giving to other candidates, and we'll speak again on Friday to assess her ability.</p>
  <p>Finally, late in the evening I had a conversation with Charlie Wang, a fellow KPCB fellow. He seemed pretty interested and wanted to read the documents. Later in the week he responded with a massive message about the go-to-market plan. I'll be meeting with him again on Tuesday to talk about it.</p>

  <h2>2021-03-04</h2>
  <p>I started Thursday by syncing back up with Mitzi, who had left Inrupt as head of community a few months ago and has now started a job at NextCloud as their Head of Strategy. We talked a bit about the future of decentralized ecosystems and Solid as well as the morality around them.</p>
  <p>After that meeting was the Solid World presentation. I was pleased to see Dmitri and Liam from Lifescope present. I liked their open source data connections to Solid which will allow us to bring data from legacy platforms (Life Facebook and LinkedIn) to Solid. The other presentation wasn't as cool IMO. It was an intellectual privacy system that I didn't think applied to Solid very much. In fact, during the Q&A one person hillariously said, "This is utopian, and I don't even know if it's a utopia we want."</p>
  <p>Beyond that, there were two Angellist interviews. No-one showed up the the first one. I don't know why people would schedule an interview and not show up. But the second one was the first time I felt good about an Angellist candidate. Garrison Snelling has experience working in startups and was able to demonstrate critical thinking, communication skills, and an overall excitement for Solid and the Databrowser in the behavioural interview. So, now it's time to pass it on to the next round of interviews. I created three challenges: a take home interview where you build a tic-tac-toe application and will explain the architectural decisions, a live coding challenge where I'll explore how he can think through things algorithmically, and finally a more in-depth discussion about the databrowser now that I've shared resources with him.</p>
  <p>In the evening, Ailin and I met up with Marques, a former co-worker for Guage insights. We got food together and Ailin offered a bottle of Mead which was very difficult to open hahaha. We noticed that this is the first time we hung out with someone other than eachother for about a month! Normally that would've made me quite depressed, but with Ailin, I didn't even notice it. In fact, I've had one of the best months of my life due to her!</p>

  <h2>2021-03-05</h2>
  <p>Friday began with more interviews. First was Karanjeet Singh, who I also felt did enought to go to the next round of technical interviews, though I haven't gotten a response from him yet, so maybe he's not as interested in O.</p>
  <p>After that, was the bi-weekly meeting with Tim. There, he confirmed that he wouldn't be able to join the company as even an official advisor, so he'll just remain an unofficial advisor. It's disappointing but I can't say I didn't see it coming. Other than that, we talked about the progress on the community solid server which looks very promising!</p>
  <p>After that, I had one Angellist interview with a guy that seemed excited about the concept, but didn't demonstrate the ability to communicate architectural concepts. So, Unfortunately he was unqualified. The next two Angellist candidates didn't show up for their interviews.</p>
  <p>We ended the day by meeting up with Brenda at "Dim Sum Palace." Ailin and I enjoyed the food and Brenda provided us with a list of other restaurants to go to so we'll never be without a restaurant idea again!</p>

  <h2>2021-03-06</h2>
  <p>On Saturday, we met up with Jennifer, Ailin's friend, again. This time we went to a Korean place called "Her name is Han" for some delicious food, then we all dominated an escape room together. Jennifer recommended a reality show called "Bling Empire" that just reinforced how powerful people should not behave hahaha.</p>

  <h2>2021-03-07</h2>
  <p>On Sunday I got back to writing Chapter 10 of Star Jump, but I'm blocked by trying to figure out Laut's motivation to do certain things to push the plot forward. Anyo and Celia have motivations that make sense, but something needs to push Laut to change her mind, and I don't know what that is yet. But, on a brighter note, I did end up planning quite a few of the later chapters. Things are coming together in my mind.</p>

  <h2>2021-03-08</h2>
  <p>Monday was back to interviews. This time all the Angellist people showed up! There were two candidates who didn't make the bar, but I was relatively happy with the other three.</p>
  <p>First, Pratish Shrestha was able to demonstrate a passion for the idea of Solid along with the ability to think through architectural solutions. He's also given talks which bolster my confidence in him. He definitely went onto the next round.</p>
  <p>Next, Michael Oppong seems a bit new to the software dev world, but he also demonstrated a love for the idea of Solid, even going as far as setting up his own Solid server to play around with it, so he also goes to the next round.</p>
  <p>And finally, Adwait More also felt good enough to go to the next round, but said he couldn't start until July. I told him we could revisit it in July but I can't promise that I'd have any positions open.</p>
