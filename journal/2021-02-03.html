  <h1>The Product Pitch (2021-01-25 to 2021-02-03)</h1>
  <p>The past week has been extremely busy, but I wanted to write a catch-up entry to catch up this journal and to help plan next steps.</p>

  <h2>2021-01-25</h2>
  <p>On Monday, I put some polishing touches on the Email-Password Interaction of the Identity provider. This marks a milestone for the IdP as it is now usable. However, there's still a code review and security review it needs to go through. It also still needs to have Client Ids put into it.</p>
 
  <h2>2021-01-26 to 2021-01-28</h2>
  <p>On Tuesday through Friday, I took the day off from IdP work to build a super document called "Backcasting Solid." Backcasting is a method used at Floodgate to determine the stages of development that are needed to get to a final goal. After these three days and staying up until 4am writing on Tuesday, the document was 23 pages of dense explanation there's still more the write. But this brianstorming exercise definitely allowed me to plan what I think is the best possible product that can be built to push Solid into the mainstream.</p>

  <p>The plan is the create a "Next Gen Data Browser." A new experience that allows users to interact with their data seamlessly. This will encourage people to make solid-compatible applets which leads to more Solid-compatible data, which allows Solid to become a "Global Database"</p>

  <h2>2021-01-29</h2>
  <p>On Friday, I got back into IdP work. Mostly I did beurocratic things like updating the architecture diagram to reflect the current state of the project and work to arrange the security review and architecture review.</p>
  <p>But, the main news is in recruiting. I'm now trying to build the perfect team to execute the next-gen data browser. Earlier in the week, I reached out to Tika because I knew she was looking for a job. After reading the document, she said it was cool, but she would want to stay within the FAANGs.</p>
  <p>I decided to only reach out to one person at a time. That would allow me to put my focus on a single individual. I reached out the Titus next. He would be perfect for this project. He's the expert on doing interesting things with JavaScript and is already building a pretty related product within PayPal. Titus seemed to consider the offer more seriously and I assured him that if he has concerns about compensation, we could work that out. Changing a job is a big decision, and I don't have a definitive answer from him yet, but I am hopeful</p>

  <h2>2021-01-30 to 2021-01-32</h2>
  <p>On the weekend, Ailin and I took some well deserved rest. We went to an escape room on Saturday Afternoon and escaped with just eight seconds to spare (Though I think a lot of hints were provided by the management). Then we took a walk around Midtown Manhattan, going to Times Square, Bryant park, Rockerfeller Plaza, and ended the day at Central Park</p>

  <p>On Saturday, we rented a car and picked up all the remaining furniture we needed for the apartment. It all just barely fit. Then we drove to New Jersey to hang out with Ailin's childhood friend, Jenny. We made it back just before the large snowstorm hit.</p>

  <h2>2021-02-01</h2>
  <p>On Monday, I returned to IdP work, beginning the Client Id flow.</p>
  <p>But the big conversation was in the evening with Marcus. I reached out to him to invite him to join the project. Like Titus, he was interested but needed more verification. The document I had written gave a high idea for the Data Browser, but no concrete details. So, I promised him I would update the document to help him get a better idea of how the Data Browser works.</p>
  
  <h2>2021-02-02</h2>
  <p>As promised, I spent Tuesday writing more detail about the product and making wireframes. I still need Wednesday to finish it up, but I'm proud of the result.</p>
  <p>At the end of the day I synced up with Andy Chen, an investor from Cotue. The previous week I had given him feedback on a decentralized DNS network. I listed out the reasons I didn't think it would work, and he thanked me for it and organized a meeting to talk about what I'm doing. I shared the product idea and he gave a few recommendations including the name of a designer that I should reach out to (and I'll definitely do that. I need a good designer). I didn't ask for money when he asked if there's anything else he could do to help out. Thiago gave me advice not to try to play investors off of each-other. It just ends in a messy situation. If I think the investor is right (and I do like Floodgate) then it's better to work with them to arrive at the best deal.</p>

  <h2>2021-02-03</h2>
  <p>I woke up today to see that Tim had commented on the "Backcasting Solid" document ahead of our meeting. Even stranger, Tim's EA, Olivia, had highlighted every part of the document where I point out how my vision for Solid differs from Inrupt's. It made me anticipate an interesting meeting.</p>
  <p>The meeting itself was disappointing. While officially our sync ups are scheduled for 30 minutes, many times we end up taking the entire hour. In hindsight, I should have asked for a longer meeting when I sent Tim and Olivia the agenda on Monday.</p>
  <p>The main point of the meeting was to discuss funding for the next-gen data browser. About six months ago, Tim said that he'd love to participate in the first funding round for whatever the new product is, and with funding on the horizon, it's time to officially talk about that. Unfortunately, Tim needed to leave for a board meeting before we could get anything hammered out. I scheduled another meeting for Monday, but that does add time to the schedule. It would have been good to at least begin to hammer out details so that I can go back to Floodgate with some knowledge on Tim's desired involvement.</p>
  <p>Another thing that concerns me is that Tim and I have slightly different views of the future for Solid. He took issue with me framing it as a "Global Database" because he sees Solid as a web of data users can interact with directly and "Global Database" implies that this is a product only for developers. It's subtle but I think I'm willing to allow app developers to abstract more of the interaction with data in the name of user friendliness than Tim is. Tim also disagreed with my interpreation that the use of top-down ontology authorities was one of the limiting factors for the original semantic web. He did say that despite the differences of opinion in the background, we've arrived at the same conclusion for what needs to be built: The Next-Gen Data Browser. I just really hope that the minute differences don't discourage Tim when it comes to this project.</p>
  <p>So, I have four days before my next meeting with Tim. But, I can still do things in that time. I still need to complete the user journies, user experience, and architecture of the document. I'll continue talking with Titus and Marcus. And I'll loop Ann from Floodgate back in.</p>
