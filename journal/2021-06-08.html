  <h1>Rethinking (2021-06-08)</h1>
  <p>This is a one off entry because I wanted to put down my thoughts day of.</p>
  <p>The day began with an early drive down to tech square. I had a meeting with the interop panel at 10 and a meeting with Thiago at 11 so, I needed to be at Tech square before 10. The interop panel went well. Justin was interested in the things that I was working on and how it could be integrated into the work the panel was doing. I gave a few of my opinions, and it seems like there exists a demand for the dev tools I've been making.</p>
  <p>Then was the meeting with Thiago, and it went pretty much as badly as it could. The good news is that what I wanted to build for Georgia Tech is a good idea. The bad news is that it's such a good idea that another company that Tech Square Ventures has invested in has already signed a $1 million deal to do it. I think that Didier just didn't know about what was happening. He said that he's meeting with Matt Lisle (someone who is probably closer to the project) to "get up to date with the internal politics" on Friday. We'll wait to see what happens there, but I expect that Fluree, a company that has existed for 5 years and has 17 employees (and growing) will leave little room for me, someone trying to get off the ground with no employees yet. The only glimmer of hope depends on Georgia Tech wanting a solution that doesn't depend on blockchain tech, but that's out of my hands at this point.</p>
  <p>The thing I'm kicking myself on is that I knew about GT's desire to use Solid all the way back in January and didn't act on it. I was too distracted with Floodgates funds. In hindsight, I was quite arrogant. I thought that just because I was one of the few people who knew Solid, a tech associated with Tim, people would be interested. I forewent pursuing a stable product with GT to chase nothing at first, and then to chase an unproven B2C product. I don't know if pursuing the GT deal earlier would have allowed me to get in before Fluree (the demo that Thiago sent me was recorded in 2019), but this still goes to show that when a good opportunity presents itself I need to take it. It took me a while to realize that there's a reason there isn't a company pursing something consumer oriented for Solid. It's because there are too many risks. Other consumer oriented companies just took tech that already existed and applied it to a new field. Look at Facebook. It was built in PHP! There's still a lot that needs to be built for Solid and I can't support a conumer company at the moment if I'm still building dev-tools. I still believe that Solid (or something like it) is the future of data, but I certainly am not being smart about how I contribute to getting there.</p>
  <p>And looming over this is that ultimatum. If the GT deal doesn't work out, I need to go back to employee work. I really don't want to. I like being able to set priorities. Inrupt wouldn't have allowed me to go and make a chat app or dev tool libraries. Though, that may have been a problem. Maybe I'm just not good at setting priorities. But, in the end, maybe its best to go back to employed work. It's been a year since quitting my job, and I think I made the right decision to do so. It did not seem like I would have any kind of career progression at Inrupt. It was becoming obvious that the leadership didn't care about the projects I was working on by the fact that every project I was working on got cancelled in one way or another. But, I still feel like I'm not where I wanted to be. Let's take a look at what I accomplished:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>I built the initial version of <a href="https://shaperepo.com">ShapeRepo</a>. It was good at communicating a vision, but ultimitely useless to anyone in the Solid ecosystem because no-one was actually building apps. It was a product for a customer that didn't exist.</li>
    <li>After building ShapeRepo I searched for people outside the Solid ecosystem who would want to use it. I learned a lot about cold calling and sales and got a lot of meetings, but again, ultimitely it wasn't a product people thought they needed and I found that the competition in the Enterprise Data Wrangling space already existed.</li>
    <li>I built <a href="https://liqid.chat">Liqid Chat</a> which got a lot of praise, but ultimitely didn't lead to much. No one really uses it on a day to day basis, and that's for a few reasons. 1. It's a little buggy and has a server side component people don't like (the new dev tools will solve that problem) and 2. there's really no reason to use it over Facebook messenger or Signal. It's just a fancy proof of concept for Solid.</li>
    <li>I talked to a lot of VCs, but nothing lead to anything. Most of the time they didn't believe Solid was solving a real problem.</li>
    <li>I made a series of videos to promote Solid, but I don't think they really are getting outside the Solid circle. People in the Solid circle seem to like them, but that hasn't lead to anything because people in the Solid circle don't have any money haha. Mostly what I get is people wanting to talk to me and ask me questions. That's fun, but I can't make a career out of free chit chat.</li>
    <li>I began the GT deal, but as listed above, that's not too promising.</li>
    <li>I wrote 12 chapters of one book and 3 chapters of another. But, that doesn't have anything to do with building a business. Plus, 15 chapters in 1 year is a pretty slow writing speed. And I'm not even a really great writer. I don't see writing as being a career pivot. It was just a hobby.</li>
    <li>I made some dev tools that seem interesting, but like most semantic web dev tools, without a full follow through, it's going to stay as an object of interest and rot. I would need an actual company or some open source funding to keep it going.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Maybe the GT project will still go through, but I need to be prepared for if it does not. Does this mean I'm asking Justin for a job? Maybe. But part of me feels like I'm still on to something here. At least the fact that GT was interested in a solution and Fluree beat me to it means there's some demand. Might there be other organizations looking for a solution here? Maybe there is. The problem is how do I find those organizations. Didier just came to the networking meeting. But, is that going to happen again with some other company? I can't depend on that.</p>
  <p>I think I'm going to need to talk to a lot of people before making this decision, the same way I talked to a lot of people before making the decision to leave Inrupt. This is going to be a bit painful, but it needs to be done.</p>
