  <h1>Hello 2021! (2021-01-01)</h1>
  <p>Whelp! 2021 is here and the first day was pretty normal. In fact, it was so normal, that I almost missed the clock ticking over into the new year! I was working on putting the <a href="../writings/homeward.html">Homeward Script</a> on the website (and boy was that script hard to format. I needed to style each part to a script format) when I looked at the clock and it was 11:59. But Ailin and I did get to see the first minute of the new year as cars honked outside our window.</p>
  <p>Yesterday, I also found out that I didn't make it into the <a href="https://www.moversandshakas.org/">Movers and Shakas</a> programme. I had applied on a whim, so I wasn't expecting to get in, but still, it would have been cool to get to be a part of a Cohort or influencers in Hawaii. But, applying did lead to one potential new opportunity. My uncle knew one of the program sponsors and introduced him to me. I talked with him and found out the people in charge of Hawaii's COVID tracking tech. It might be the perfect use case for Solid. People could store a verification of vaccine reception on their Pods and present it to a place like Hawaii. I was waiting to see if I got into Movers and Shakas to continue exploring the opportunity, but now that I've been rejected, I should get back to exploring.</p>
  <p>I didn't wake up until 10AM today. Hopefully that's not going to be a reoccurring thing in 2021. I did Chinese practice and some work on the Identity Provider that Inrupt has contracted me to build. Today was all about designing an architecture for the Identity Provider. I've already completed an initial version that works, but Ruben prefers relying on configuration in Dependency Injection over just writing code. It honestly makes the entire thing very unwieldy because I have to instantiate entire components in configuration just to render a single page! I'm not done with it yet. I'll finish it tomorrow, but my progress is picture below.</p>

  <p>Other than that, enjoy this picture of me with Licky!</p>
