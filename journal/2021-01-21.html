  <h1>Sick days (2021-01-21)</h1>
  <p>These past three days have been pretty similar. In the morning I would feel extremely groggy because I've been a bit under the weather. I'd take some meetings then take a nap. Maybe do a few odd house chores, but I wouldn't start doing anything really productive until the afternoon. I'd get the work I need to do done, but there's still that lingering guilt that I should be up earlier.</p>
  <p>Beyond the standard meetings I usually take, I had my weekly meeting with Tim on Wednesday. Funny side note, Tim accidentally joined the meeting I was having with Matthieu on Tuesday thinking that it was time to meet. I don't know how he found that time. It wasn't in his calendar. But, Matthieu said that had only been the second time he had talked to Tim. Anyway, at the meeting. showed off Liqid chat for the first time. There were an embarrassing number of bugs in the demo and I recorded each of them. But, despite the rough journey, Tim seemed really happy. He said it was great progress and asked if I was using this as my primary chat with anyone. I told him that once the bugs were worked out, I plan to use it with Ailin, James, and him as my primary chat.</p>
  <p>Finally, on Thursday afternoon, I decided that I need to start getting together my plan to turn O into a full fledged startup. That means I need a concentrated plan on what I'm building and I need to start exploring who I'll hire. I created an outline of a blogpost I'll write as my plan. This will eventually be sent to Ann and Michael if they want to read it before our next meeting. I outline where I want Solid to be in the future and the steps it will take to get it there. From there, I'll have another post that describes that kind of product that could thrive in the current Solid ecosystem</p>
  <p>As for finding people to work with, I reached out to Tika because I knew she was thinking of leaving Microsoft soon, but she said that she's only looking at the big companies. I don't know anyone else who is thinking about changing jobs soon, but I'll reach out to other friends to gauge interest soon.</p>
  <p>Speaking of changing jobs, I'm continuing to encourage Ailin to change careers. It just feels like she's having a bit of a toxic experience with her co-workers. And while we were discussing improving her react skills for interviews, I suggested that she gets involved in Liqid chat. I wouldn't assign her any bugs, only features because those would be a lot more fun. We haven't started yet, but I'm excited to start helping her build. Who knows, maybe if she becomes skilled enough there's a future for her in the Solid world!</p>
  <p>So, over the next couple days, there are three main focuses:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Fix at least one bug in Liqid chat. I've turned it into a game show (with Ailin as the captive audience) where I pick a random number and that random number is the bug I work on!</li>
    <li>Do a full day of work on the Community Serve IdP</li>
    <li>Organize thoughts around creating a company</li>
  </ul>
