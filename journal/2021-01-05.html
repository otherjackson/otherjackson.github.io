  <h1>All the boxes are shipped (2021-01-05)</h1>
  <p>Quote of the day by Ailin: "Basketball is my favorite fruit."</p>
  <p>Today I did more work on the chat app, and realized that there's a glitch that doesn't allow two people to log in at the same time! I haven't been able to find the source, but it was a funny find. I also tried the app out on Ailin's iPhone for the first time, and it seemed to be working fine.</p>
  <p>We shipped out the boxes today. Well honestly Ailin did a lot of the work, and I'm super greatful for it. So, now the boxes are on their way to NY and we only have the things we'll carry in our luggage right now.</p>
  <p>It looks like the Democrats are going to win Georgia, so it's very probable that my vote mattered more this election than it ever has!</p>
