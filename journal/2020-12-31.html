  <h1>Goodbye 2020 (2020-12-31)</h1>
  <p>Whelp. 2020 is almost over and that means it's time for New Years resolutions. And given how bad people claim 2020 was, there is no better time to start something new that will make 2021 better. For me, I think that will be keeping a journal. It might be fun and it could help me stay productive. It would be embarrassing to have journal article that said "All I did today was watch videos of people building theme parks in computer games." (Something that I have sadly done more than once)</p>
  <p>In truth, my 2020 wasn't all that bad. I struck out on my own to start a company around Solid after working at Inrupt for a while. While I wasn't necessarily a blow-out success - I'm not currently CEO of a Unicorn - it wasn't a failure so far. Right now, I consider myself a freelance contractor for Solid. Though, the only freelancing I've done so far was for Inrupt. While that sounds like that means I haven't made any progress, I'm enjoying the freedom on not bing 100% bound to a company. And I do have a pipeline of prospects coming in. On Tuesday I talked with the VP of Data Analytics and Georgia Tech about a possible project to use Solid as a Digital Backpack. That's fun! Especially because I'd love for Georgia Tech to really get involved with Solid.</p>
  <p>Outside the career, in 2020 I also started learning Chinese. I'm not super good yet, though I think I'd be able to pass the HSK1 test (The lowest level of Chinese proficiency. It's not too impressive but it's a start). 我今年不能说话好的中文！ 明年学！ Ailin's learning along with me, though she's a lot more proficient haha.</p>
  <p>I've also been writing books. Yes, that's books plural because apparently I can't stay focused. At the moment I've written 8 chapters of a Sci-Fi Space Opera about three aliens from different backgrounds who go on an adventure called "Star Jump." I've also completed 2 chapters of a comedy book along the lines of "Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy" called "Baby's First Roadtrip".</p>
  <p>So, here's hoping 2021 will be an amazing year. We'll see if I actually keep up with journaling because it seems like whenever I decide to do that it lasts for a week before I give up lol.</p>
