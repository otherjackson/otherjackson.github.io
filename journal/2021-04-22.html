  <h1>More Liqid Chat Users (2021-04-14 to 2021-04-22)</h1>
  <p>Whelp. I didn't take notes of what I did each day this week, so guess we'll have to go from memory.</p>

  <h2>2021-04-14</h2>
  <p>On Wednesday, I spent a lot of time writing the journal post. One of the problems with taking notes is that you certainly do have a lot to write about. I may have gotten some work done on Liqid Chat, but I don't remember.</p>
  <p>Towards the evening Ailin and I went out to pick up food from all over the lower eastside. I'm glad we decided to live here. I didn't know it at the time, but the Lower Eastside is the best place for food in Manhattan! I'd say that this is the best place to live in Manhattan because of that!</p>
  <p>After that, I had a meeting with Cameron, a collegue of Sharon who's working on getting the Australian government to adopt Solid. I told him all about the project and the need for funding, and he said that there's a non-profit that might be interested in my work. It's call Mindaroo. He said he'd get me connected. It also seems like he's trying to start some kind of community-based Solid initiative for Australia.</p>

  <h2>2021-04-15</h2>
  <p>On Thursday, I needed to refactor the file upload code to support new file types and I also got video upload to work. Finally, I fixed a crash that was happening on mobile when you tried to create a 1 on 1 chat.</p>

  <h2>2021-04-16</h2>
  <p>On Friday, I deployed all the new updates to the app store, play store, and web.</p>
  <p>I also began work on the presenation I'll give on Liqid Chat to Solid World. In the presenation, I want the big takeaway to be Liqid Chat is a Solid chat client with a lot of features. So, I got an idea to do a "Liqid Chat Feature Speed Round" where I just flip through slides with screenshots at a quick rate. Then I decided that everything I say should rhyme. I asked Ailin if I should turn it into a song, and she said why not. So I wrote lyrics to the tune of "Turkey in the Straw." I was feeling pretty good about it until I looked up "Turkey in the Straw" and found that it had a history in Minstral Shows. That's sad because the tune was perfect for the presentation, but it's better the play it safe, so I'll just speak the lines rather than sing them.</p>
  <p>Also, I had my interview with Kai. I think it went well. We covered topics like my past and a few of my opinions in Solid. I need to sent the interview over to Olivia to get approval to post. She wanted any time I mention Tim's name in public to be cleared by Tim's staff, which seems a bit overbearing, but I'm not going to rock the boat.</p>

  <h2>2021-04-16</h2>
  <p>On Saturday I finished up the presentation and sent it out for approval. I don't really remember doing anything else.</p>

  <h2>2021-04-17</h2>
  <p>On Sunday, we went to work out at a place called Con-Body, and it was hard haha. This was the first time I went to a gym or exercise class since the pandemic started, and we basically established that I do not have good stamina at the moment.</p>
  <p>But after that we picked up some Boba Tea and got Congee and had a relaxing day.</p>

  <h2>2021-04-17</h2>
  <p>On Monday, I posted the first of 3 Liqid-chat specific videos I prepared. With photo uploading now implemented and deployed, I want to start promoting Liqid Chat more. It's fun whenever a new person pops in. But, I might be spending too much time just talking with people on Liqid Chat. Then again, it's good to talk to build up a sense of community.</p>
  <p>I also fixed my twitter crawler to be able to handle "too many request" errors. I pointed it at the project_solid account to get all the people with over 1000 followers.</p>
  <p>I also met up with Cameron again. It feels like he wants to manage the relationship between me and Minderoo, so I haven't gotten a connection yet. I'm sure to clearly communicate that a connection is what I want, but there's nothing I can do if he doesn't want to give it. Otherwise we talked about some Solid ecosystem related things and how the databrowser can be placed inside the ecosystem.</p>

  <h2>2021-04-18</h2>
  <p>On Tuesday, I spent a lot of time following people on Twitter. I thought that there would be more investors and reporters following Solid, but apparently not. I'm still glad I connected with a lot of people, but funding-wise, I don't think it proved very productive.</p>
  <p>I also had a meeting with someone who reach out to me, Sophia. She just left her job at Google and is interested in Solid. I gave her some places where she could go, and we talked aobut my work. She gave a pretty good suggestion on how to handle extending a shape with finite enums. You would make sure that one of the enums is always "Other" and any additional enums would extend that.</p>
  <p>In the evening, I reached out to everyone on Twitter named "Jackson Morgan" for fun.</p>

  <h2>2021-04-19</h2>
  <p>I started the day by posting the next video on Liqid Chat, and it feels like more people are coming to it. As of the time of writing this, Liqid Chat has 112 users, which isn't huge, but it does indicate progress. I feel like the social media effort is slowly paying off.</p>
  <p>I had a lot of meetings, starting with one with Sacha who is a french semantic data specialist. I introduced him to various things in the Solid ecosystem and shared what I was working on.</p>
  <p>After that was the Solid team meeting, and the focus was on the diversity and inclusion initiative Marrelle is spearheading. She suggested that we include more HBCUs in the Solid ecosystem and I said I'd send some emails and see if we can get connected to Morehouse and Spelman.</p>
  <p>After that was a very long meeting with the founder of Graphmetrix where I finally got technical explanations for what they're doing. They're structuring all data as the result of events in an event-based database design. He was also interested in Liqid Chat to embed in their own UI. I said that while I can't implement features specifically for them, I could build some general features that would allow them to embed it.</p>
  <p>Finally I synced up with Danny Done who is working on raising money for his HR related Solid Startup. I think it was really productive and we started making a vision around what how his HR vision works into the data browser. So, given I get funding, we have an app developer hahaha!</p>
  <p>Then I worked on Liqid Chat fixing a few bugs. Now that more people are using it, I'm getting a lot more bug reports.</p>
  <p>I cooked dinner and ate with Ailin, then exercised. James called while I was exercising and said he wanted to play Minecraft, so I hopped on a server with him and played for a while.</p>
  <p>Ailin seems to be working later and later each day. I'm afraid for her mental health because from what I hear, there's still some toxic behaviour from her managers at IBM. I want to support her, but it's a tough spot.</p>

  <h2>2021-04-19</h2>
  <p>I started the day off by cleaning the apartment, because it needed it haha! Ailin's friend, Nancy, will be coming this weekend, but I wasn't even thinking about that when I decided to clean. Then I did the journal and now we're here.</p>
