  <h1>New Login Flow (2021-01-04)</h1>
  <p>Oh wow, I did not sleep well last night. The thin yoga mat was too thin and my mind couldn't stop thinking about tiny improvements that can be made to the chat app as well as the phone call Trump had with Secretary of State Raffensperger. But, I think we've rearranged the blankets correctly now so that both sides of the bed are comfortable to sleep on. Ailin even offered to let me sleep on the other side of the bed with the thicker yoga mat, so I think everything's good.</p>
  <p>I did a bit of work on the Identity Provider today. Matthieu and I had a long conversation about some architectural details and we think it's ready to go before Ruben. Unfortunately, Ruben is not avialable for a meeting until Friday, so I'm putting paid work on hold until then.</p>
  <p>We're packing up for our move to NY, and Ailin's been amazing. All the boxes are organized and ready to leave tomorrow when the shipping crew arrives. I tested to see if all of the "bed" components fit in my checked luggage. That way they're available from the beginning just in case we don't find a real bed that first day.</p>
  <p>I also implemented a new login flow on the chat app. I can't believe I didn't know about the "expo-web-browser" library before! It has fantastic tools for redirecting to a web browser on native. I'm still not done with the mobile implementation, but it's getting close.</p>
