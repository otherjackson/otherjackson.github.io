  <h1>An Unknown Future (2021-03-09 to 2021-03-15)</h1>

  <h2>2021-03-09</h2>
  <p>On Tuesday, I wrote a journal entry, but didn't have nearly as many interviews scheduled. The only one was a no-show. I honestly don't remember what I did all day :|. But, in the evening, I had a talk with Charlie Wang. We went over the product, and he said he was interested, it's just a risky bet. So, he'd need to think about it.</p>
  
  <h2>2021-03-10</h2>
  <p>Wednesday began with a Solid team meeting. I was sure to get some statistics about the Solid community to help me evaluate the immediate market size. It's good to hear that Solid World was growing. Marrelle also now has forms to sign up for the next Solid World. I got the idea that I should finally present Liqid Chat at Solid World. It would be a good test of go-to-market strategies for the Databrowser. If I can get a good number of users on Liqid chat, then I should be able to do the same for the Databrowser</p>
  <p>Next was a collection of interviews. First was Garrison Snelling's second interview. He was okay, but didn't knock it out of the park. I think he may be someone to look into later, but for a founding team he's got some work to do.</p>
  <p>The other two interviews were nothing of consequence.</p>
  <p>After work, I met up with Sidney at a restaurant near Washington Square. It was a fun time. I really never knew Sidney and I had so much in common. We didn't hang out as much when we were at IBM. So, I hope to see more of him later while I'm in New York.</p>

  <h2>2021-03-11</h2>
  <p>I started Wednesday with another investor meeting. This time with Siliconroad.vc, a firm Brad recommended. I looked at their portfolio and they seemed to only invest in B2B companies, so I didn't have my hopes too high. And I was right. They said it was interesting, but not a good fit.</p>
  <p>After that, I spent the day preparing LiqidChat to deploy to the Play Store. Turns out, there's a lot you need to do before you can deploy, and I accidentally bundled the chat pointing to the dev server, so I'll need to fix that.</p>
  <p>The meeting with Ali Partovi got bumped again to Monday. :(</p>
  <p>Then Ailin and I watched Raya and the last dragon! It was fun, but a bit rushed. I think that a world that big would either need to be explored in a TV show or as a multiple movies.</p>
  <p>At the end of the day I talked to Titus, and got closure on the fact that he wanted to stay at PayPal.</p>

  <h2>2021-03-12</h2>
  <p>Friday had six interviews, the three notable ones were with Michael Oppong, Sharon, and Pratish Shrestha. Michael had an amazing attitude, but wasn't technically ready for the position. The same was true for Sharon. But, Pratish Shrestha passed the technical screening! He also provided some excellent notes on the Next-Gen Databrowser document.</p>
  <p>At the end of the day, I got some disappointing news. Thiago had told me we was going to talk with the rest of the investment team about funding O, and asked if there was any progress with Floodgate. This was the excuse I needed to reach out to them. And I got back a message saying "I would say that we are very interested, but not quite ready. Probably best to talk in person though so I can walk you through our thoughts and see if we can still find a path in the future?"</p>
  <p>I thought a lot about the future of O. I still had Thiago (though I am unsure how Floodgate dropping out would affect it) and I still have yet to talk to Ali Partovi, but what if I don't seal any funding. I planned out a stripped down version of the Databrowser I could deliver myself. The problem with this is it may have some security problems in Verifiable Credentials isn't implemented, and I wouldn't have the resources to update ShapeRepo, build dev tools, a Global Data Index, and React Native support (It would only be web facing). But, it's still a potential plan.</p>
  <p>I also thought about the Angellist interviews. I've gone through thirty candidates and found 1 qualified one. These interviews take a lot of time, so at least for now, I'm going to put a hold on them (especially with funding in question). I'll still do the interviews that people have already scheduled for next week, but I'm not going to accept any more candidates.</p>

  <h2>2021-03-13 to 2021-03-14</h2>
  <p>Over the weekend, I completed Chapter 10 of Star Jump after spending a lot of time trying to think of Laut's motivation. I don't know if I mentioned this, but I reread Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone to observe how the story is structured, and I found it doesn't exactly follow the pacing of the Hero's journey. There's a lot more set up and the climax isn't as long. That makes me feel a bit better if I end up needing to trim the climax. I don't know if I'll be able to finish this book in under 70,000 words. Chatper 10 is the longest chapter yet at about 4,500 words. If that trend continues I'm going to have a 90k or 100k word book by the end of Chapter 24!</p>

  <h2>2021-03-15</h2>
  <p>And that brings us to Monday. Lots is happening. Thiago has the investor meeting and I'll be meeting with Ali Partovi and Mike Maples, but before that I need to fix the Android deploy of Liqid Chat and work on the iOS deploy. We'll see what the day has in store for me.</p>
