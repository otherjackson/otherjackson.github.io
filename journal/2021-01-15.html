  <h1>Repent (2021-01-15)</h1>
  
  <p>There are a few things I need to repent for:</p>
  <p>Firstly, I skipped a day of journaling, but that's probably fine. I don't need to journal every day</p>
  <p>Secondly, we got a phone call from the NYC Sheriff's office saying that we need to be quarantining for ten days after our arrival. I didn't know that this was an official policy on NYC, and I wish I had known about it before we went picking up furniture and out to pick up food from restaurants. But, now that we've received the automated call, we're going to be quarantining through Monday. We'll be fine. Ailin ordered a bunch of food from Whole Foods (She has Amazon prime, so she gets free delivery), and I ordered a bunch of Soylent.</p>
  <p>Thirdly, I need to repent for my meeting with Ann. It started out well. We were in agreement over quite a few things. Namely, the privacy and AI worlds do not need to be in conflict, data is currently monopolized, but it doesn't need to be, and a system like Solid would actually make it easier to expose data to the rest of the world (at your permission). I even gave an insight she seemed to like: In a world where data isn't monopolized, the value proposition of companies becomes the algorithm and models for accessing and manipulating that data. But, I should have known I wouldn't get very far without having a product idea I'm completely settled on. She advised that I settle on something then I could easily raise a half million to work on it. I told her that I think I know what it is, but I'm going to develop the idea a bit more before returning.</p>
  <p>I also had the follow up call with Joy, and I'm glad I did. She told me about some supply chain work that she would like to do. If she gets traction on it, it could be rolled into Solid.</p>
  <p>In other news, I'm making good progress on the IdP, and we watched Wonder Woman 1984. The trailers had me pretty hyped, but the movie itself was just okay. Though the cheesy acting of Pedro Pascal was a huge plus. There was one scene where Gal Gadot was giving a speech in a soft voice and Pascal responded with cheesy yelling. The contrast was hilarious.</p>
