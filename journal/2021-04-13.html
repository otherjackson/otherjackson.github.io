  <h1>COVID Shot (2021-04-05 to 2021-04-13)</h1>
  <p>Hey! I actually took notes on the things I did each day so that I don't have a group of days where I say "I forgot what I did."</p>

  <h2>2021-04-05</h2>
  <p>On Monday the bulk of my work time was spent editing the rest of the social media videos for the next batch. I think that it was a good decision to decrease the frequency of uploads. It didn't seem like daily uploads meant a continually growing audience. My audience seems to be about the same, but at least having a consistent upload schedule keeps people in the know. My audience isn't huge. But I do enjoy the occasional comment and reshare from people who want to spread the word about Solid.</p>
  <p>One concern that I have is that perhaps the number of people interested in Solid is smaller than I anticipated. By far, my most successful post was one comparing Solid to Blockchain and I think that's because I just tapped into the blockchain audience in addition to the Solid audience. But, I'm going to continue promoting things, and I'll be presenting at Solid World next month, so that's an opportunity to get exposed to one of the largest Solid-interested audiences.</p>
  <p>I had two conversations today. The first was with Alicia Lau, the person who runs the KP Fellows Program now. We talked about a year ago and she reached out to see how things are going. I told her about the product and how I was raising money. I hadn't reached out to her before because I didn't think KP did pre-seeds, but she said they sometimes do it, so she'd ask around. A few days later I got a message that said that it isn't a good fit, but that one of the investors wants to connect.</p>
  <p>I also had a conversation with an Entrepreneur named Danny Done. He had followed me on Twitter a while back and I just reached out to him to sync up. He wants to build a Solid-based HR platform. I also explained what I wanted to build to him and he like the idea of the "Global Data Index" even going as far as saying it was needed for what he was building. But, I don't know if this conversation will go anywhere. He seems like he's in a pretty early stage as well. Whenever I talk to others in the Solid community I see where they're getting their funding from and it seems Danny is independently wealthy from selling is last business.</p>

  <h2>2021-04-06</h2>
  <p>I spent most of Tuesday working on making sure Liqid Chat is compatible with NextCloud, and now it is! I talked with Yvo Brevoort of NextCloud to make sure everything was working fine.</p>

  <h2>2021-04-07</h2>
  <p>On Wednesday, I sat down with Tom Haegemans, CEO of Digita. He originally reached out to me because he was thinking that he wanted to hire me to write some videos. I explained what I was working on and what I wanted to work on, and asked him if he knew any investors in the Solid community. He revealed to me that he raised almost all of his money by applying to EU grants. There's apparently a lot of interest in Solid in the EU grant community. He even said that I could probably do the same thing by registering my company in Estonia and applying as well. That felt a bit sketch to me. It made sense for him since Digita is based in Belgium, but I'm not an EU citizen. If I do apply for the grants I need to make it very clear that I am not an EU citizen. Maybe they'd still be interested just because I'm working on Solid, but I'm not super hopeful on that.</p>
  <p>I also synced back up with Brad. This time it wasn't about funding. This time it was about the Liqid Chat strategy. I've grown Liqid Chat's userbase to about 85 people, but I need something else to give it a push. Brad said he's been talking to some Tech Crunch reporters and he'd love to put in a recommendation for a story. I still haven't heard back from him on that. I've learned that you have to push Brad a few times before he follows through, but that's fine. I want to get image uploading in Liqid Chat before I go to the presses with it.</p>
  <p>Another thing I want to get in Liqid Chat is keeping your messages safe. Right now, anyone can send a message and pretend to be you, so to prevent that, I now have Liqid Chat generate a signed credential that says this message was made by a certain individual. It's not a permanent solution. It's not interoperable at all as Liqid Chat is the one signing the credential. But, at least if I get a flood of people in, they won't be able to pretend to be other people. There still is a problem with the "LongChat" format that allows you to delete anyone's message, but at least you can't spoof other people.</p>
  <p>Finally, I did a few UI improvement, like a new homepage to better explain what Liqid Chat is, a UI to tell you when a message is unverifieied, and a UI to explain to users that they need to grant Liqid Chat "control" access so that it can make new chats.</p>

  <h2>2021-04-08</h2>
  <p>On Thursday, I finished up the signed credential flow on Liqid Chat. I also modified that UI that displays chat participants to have a drop down menu that lets you access people's WebIds</p>
  <p>Finally, most of my work went into making Liqid Chat compatible with markdown. This allows you to create bullet points, tables, and clickable links. You can also put in images manually, though I want a fully fleshed out image upload feature too.</p>
  <p>In the evening I got inspiration for an Epilogue to Star Jump. One problem is that I kill off the most threatening villian at the end of the first one, so I want to show that the threat continues. So, there's no better time to introduce the next villain of the series.</p>

  <h2>2021-04-09</h2>
  <p>Friday was the day I started on the quest to get photos to upload, which was a lot trickier than expected. Turns out react native has a very particular way to do file uploads (through form/mulipart) but Solid servers accept file uploads as raw binaries. So I needed to build a bridge in the API to receive a form/multipart and make a request to the Pod with a binary. It took most of the day to do that.</p>
  <p>I also had a conversation with Hakon Reisvang, the Chief Marketing Officer of graphmetrix. He wasn't super technical so he couldn't tell me a lot about the product they're working on other than vague generalities, but he did say he'd introduce me to some other team members of Graphmetrix. Other than that, a lot of the conversation was him talking about philosophy. He brought up a guy name Jordan Peterson a lot. I remember Dr. Peterson from back in the day when I was a die-hard Libertarian. I was kind of ambivalent about his teachings (I was more of a Bryan Caplan and Austrian Economics fan who didn't focus on the social aspects as much), but some of my friends were very avid followers of him. Hearing that Hakon talk so much about Peterson made me feel uneasy, and it took a bit of thought to understand why. At first I thought it might have been because over the past two years I've been hanging out with Silicon Valley Elites, Europeans, and Progressives (some groups that typically disagree with Jordan Peterson's works, though apparently not all Europeans. According to Hakon, Norwegians are not "Politically Correct"). Maybe I also came to disagree with them. But, I don't think that was it. I don't remember a lot of the actual subastance behind what Jordan Peterson says, and therefore I can't really say if I agree or disagree with it myself (I heard parts of his philosophy are anti-trans, so that's horrible. But I've also been told that's a mischaracterization and I haven't put in the research to determine myself). But then I realized the part that bothered me was how it was continually shoe-horned into a conversation about Solid. It felt like he was trying to force connections between the ideology and the work that needs to be done. One of the things that deescalated me from hard-core libertarian was how draining it was to constantly try to contort things to fit with a single, unflexible worldview. Like in the past, I would need to make huge logical leaps to explain how actually deregulating healthcare would lead us to better healthcare prices. Similarly, I found any connection Hakon tried to make between Solid and resistance against "Postmodernism" to be tenuous. That's not to say that his ideology is wrong. I don't know a lot about it. Maybe a more skilled pundit could have made better connections. It just felt contrived. There's also the fact that I know Jordan Peterson is polarizing, and I don't want any kind of association to be alienating to a large group of people. I'm working on Solid so that everyone (Both those who like Peterson and dislike him) can own their own data and see the benefits of interoperability.</p>

  <h2>2021-04-10</h2>
  <p>On Saturday I built part of the photo upload UI that allows you to select photos for uploading.</p>
  <p>I also got my first dose of the COVID shot. I was so lucky to find an opening at the location less than a block away from me! Ailin wanted hers as soon as possible and had to go all the way to Brooklyn...</p>

  <h2>2021-04-11</h2>
  <p>And it HURT! Not the shot. That was surprisingly painless. But on Sunday my arm had a constant dull pain and was extremely painful to move. I had trouble sleeping until I found that keeping my arm at a right angle with a pillow against my body was the least bad position. I'm still glad to have it, but the pain occupied too much of my mental space haha.</p>
  <p>I completed the photo upload UI. The part that shows the photos and files you have queued to send.</p>

  <h2>2021-04-12</h2>
  <p>I had a horrible sleep due to the vaccine. It gave me a strange nightmare. In it, I was out in the Valley because one of my connections had told me they had set up a meeting with someone powerful who might be interested in Solid. When I arrived, I discovered the connection was Mark Zuckerberg. I was surprised but I concluded that I should just pitch to him all the benefits of self data ownership and interoperability. Maybe he is genuinely interested in changing the way Facebook is run and helping out the Solid community. If he starts suggesting things I disagree with, I can always cut ties. But, Zuckerberg seemed to be extremely focused on my business card which labeled me as "CEO of O." He said that it seemed a bit presumptuous for me to put "CEO" on a business card when I'm a one man show at the moment. I gave some explanation about how I didn't list myself as CEO anywhere else, but he didn't seem too happy about that. Then he hit me with the dreaded, "I'm sorry but I do have to cut this short due to another commitment. Is there anything else I can do for you." I woke up as I tried to formulate a concise way to pitch Solid and the Databrowser to Mark Zuckerberg before he left.</p>
  <p>I spent Monday figuring out how to get the MimeTypes for the images and files to behave properly in edge cases and implementing the UI for showing images in the chat. A UI I am still not happy with.</p>
  <p>Finally, I ended the day by relaxing and finally watching Godzilla vs Kong. It was very stupid, but fun.</p>

  <h2>2021-04-13</h2>
  <p>I began Tuesday with a conversation with Kai Gilb co-founder of Graphmetrix. I think Hakon set up the conversation and Kai wanted to get to know me before inviting me on a podcast like thing. We talked about Solid, and my personal interests, but mostly I asked questions about Graphmetrix. Again, I was disappointed that I didn't get any technical answers about what they do. Kai kept saying things like "It uses AI that thinks like humans do. No one else is doing this," which I find to be a pretty bold claim to make if you can't at least point me to a whitepaper explaining the concept. I find hiding behind "that's the secret sauce" to be dubious. It sounds like the other founder, Fred Gibson, knows all the tech. So, I look forward to meeting Fred at some point. I also asked about monitization strategy. From what I can deduce, they're a construction software company at their core that happens to be using Solid. They were able to raise a friends and family round because they can promise turnaround in the B2B construction industry. But, I look forward to doing the "podcast" with Kai on Friday.</p>
  <p>Liqid.chat wise, I worked on the UI for displaying images, but it's still not 100% right. I found that the core of the problem is how I'm structuring my data so that will need to be changed.</p>
  <p>I mostly distracted myself by writing a couple of things. First I wrote a bit more on "Baby's First Roadtrip," then I was inspired by Godzilla vs Kong to write the first scene of a monster movie. You can see that <a href="../writings/mostrocities.html">here</a></p>

  <h2>2021-04-14</h2>
  <p>So here we are. Today. After writing this I'm noticing that it's been a pretty cynical week. That's not how I want to be. I feel like I've been taking a passive approach this week, and I don't want to be passive. I want to be active. So, let's assess the situation and pivot our approach:</p>

  <h3>Funding</h3>
  <p>This week I discovered a few things about funding: There's no such thing as a "Solid Friendly Investor." Digita raised its money from EU grants, Graphmetrix raised from friends and family, Janeiro Digital already had money from their consulting business, and Inrupt did actually raise money, but they have Tim as CTO so that doesn't apply to me.</p>
  <p>Knowing this I cannot keep trying to find "Solid Friendly Investors." I can swap my focus to a broader context of "Decentralized Friendly Investors." Of course I will continue to pitch people in my network, but I may have more successes if I reach out to DWeb investors. I already built a Twitter crawler that gets all the important users subscribed to a certain account. I've pointed it at Solid's accounts. We'll see if I can do the same for things like IPFS and Blockchain tech. This doesn't mean that I won't still talk to people in my network, but those meetings come up passively, so my active strategy should be around finding DWeb friendly investors.</p>

  <h3>Social Media</h3>
  <p>After running the social media accounts for about a month there are a few take-aways. Firstly, I don't think the account is doing a fantastic job at attracting new people to the Solid Community. It may have attracted a few, but in general, the people who've commented or shared are people who were already interested in Solid. What it is good at is attracting attention to me within the Solid community. That sounds kinda selfish, but hey, if the goal is to promote the cool things I want to do for Solid, it's a useful tool.</p>
  <p>Though, that means I need a new strategy for attracting people outside the Solid Community. And I think that comes with cross promotion. Maybe reach out to some other people in the decentralized community asking for a feature. That will bring more attention to Solid. So I need to reach out to other promoters. I just need to figure out how to do that. Maybe I could talk to Wendy from the internet archive.</p>
  
  <h3>Liqid.chat</h3>
  <p>I think I'm making okay progress on Liqid Chat. This next update is going to be the big one that gets it ready for prime time. Thought I do wish that I would get it done faster. I've been distracting myself recently and I just need to hunker down and finish this thing. I think everyone who's signed up is from the Solid Community, but maybe I could create a strategy of inviting your friends. That would mean that I'd need to streamline the process to invite someone to join a chat. That's made a little bit more difficult by the fact that you need a Pod first, but maybe there are a few things I could do to streamline that sign-up process.</p>
