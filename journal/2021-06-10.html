  <h2>2021-06-09</h2>
  <p>Wednesday was a day of travel. It began with the bi-weekly team meeting. We talked tech a little bit about shapes. At the end, I mentioned that Inrupt had not yet gotten back to me about the SolidOS auth upgrade. He said that should be a top priority, so we'll see if Emmet has made any progress on it.</p>
  <p>After that, there was a Solid Team meeting. I mostly listened in on it. There was one portion where Marelle asked for more participation, and I volunteered to be in reserve for whatever's needed. We'll see what that yeilds in the future.</p>
  <p>Then it was off to the airport. My flight was delayed by four hours so I had a lot of time to get things done. I spent it writing the first part of Chapter 13 of StarJump. I'm afraid this chapter is going to be too long. That's been a problem lately. I plan my chapters to be around 3000 words, but I think I want to stuff too many things into them. I've also been listening to some lectures on writing from Brandon Sanderson. Eventually, I arrived back in New York.</p>

  <h2>2021-06-10</h2>
  <p>I've been feeling lost ever since the momentum stopped on the Georgia Tech project. There's still a chance that it will happen (Didier's meeting with Matt today so there might be some internal condition that makes them want two solutions for credential tracking), but I'm not betting on it. My original plan was to just spend the day working on StarJump, but I only completed a page of writing. Part of it was that I'm once again feeling stuck on Laut's motivations. She needs to make a big decision and I don't know if there's enough set up for her to make that decision. But, part of it was just me being distracted.</p>
  <p>Eventually, towards the end of the day, I decided to stop writing and went to brainstom with Ailin. I admitted that I didn't like the Georgia Tech ultimatum that I had imposed on myself. I wanted to build something more than just whatever an employer wanted. I knew I could handle the engineering challenges, but building a business case for Solid is where my weaknesses lie. That's where I want to improve and just going to work for someone else won't help with that. I tried to do that at Inrupt, consistently asking to be more involved in the product process, but never getting the opportunity. I love Justin, but I don't know if working for him would bring different results.</p>
  <p>But, one of the problems with being bad at finding a business case, is that, well, I'm bad at it. So, I went through a thought experiment with Ailin. If I came to me asking for $500k, what idea would I invest in. At first this technique didn't work super well. Ailin said that it makes sense to diversify your investments like a mutual fund. If we were to apply that ideology to what I'm working on "diversifying my investments," would be making dev tools or the databrowser and pumping out a bunch of apps to see which one sticks. I admitted that I wouldn't invest in that, which is sobering given this is what I've been pitching to investors. Pumping out apps is won't allow me to focus on one thing and make it the best thing possible. So, if we're going to make something that I would invest $500k in, it needs to be something with a decent chance of being successful without relying on the random chance that one thing out of a corpus on medeocre apps becomes successful. So there are a few criteria:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>I must start with a problem. In the past I've been trying to find problems to fit Solid. I just need to find <strong>problems</strong> whether or not they fit Solid. Having a solution in search of a problem is too limiting.</li>
    <li>The problem must be compelling enough so that an imperfect solution is still enticing to its users. I'm still a 1 man team after all. I can't make perfect. I can make "usable." So, even if the product I build is low on features, the probelm needs to be compelling enough that the initial users won't care.</li>

    <li>It shouldn't require a huge investment to get going. It should be something that I can build by myself.</li>
    <li>It needs to be in a space that I am at least somewhat familiar. I need to be able to get customers for this, so a completely new space wouldn't be advisable. For example, I would love to build automatically optimizing supply chains between organizations, but while I think that's cool, I have no supply chain experience. I would need to spend a bunch of time getting up to speed on supply chain and networking with people in that world. I need something that can leverage at least part of the network I already have which includes:
      <ul>
        <li>Software Developers</li>
        <li>People interested in Solid/Decentralized Tech</li>
        <li>Venture Capitalists (that admittedly have passed on me)</li>
        <li>Product People</li>
        <li>Startup Founders</li>
        <li>People pursuing government tech deals but not the government decision makers themselves</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>It shouldn't involve long sales cycles. Preferably, it wouldn't involve sales cycles at all. If there's one thing that's become clear, it's that I am not good at enterprise sales. I need to be playing to my strengths and avoiding weaknesses. I've been working at this for a year at this point and it's crunch time to get something working. I can't spend any more time twiddling my thumbs waiting for a sales cycle to complete. That pretty much limits it to B2C businesses.</li>
    <li>It needs to be monitizable in a moral way. No predatory practices or depending on the fact that people don't know their data is being taken and used.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>So, I began brainstorming problems to solve. Problems that I'm familiar with. Problems that are pervasive to our current period of history.</p>
  <p>I started with a problem Ailin and I talk about a bit: making new friends in a digital era (especially when you're out of school and in a new city). There've been apps that tried this before, but we've always wondered why none got it right. I came up with some kind of app that allows you to connect with people for a brief conversation, but I think this thought was a dead end because there's so many open questions around actually building something successful for human connection.</p>
  <p>But, it did spark and idea that could work. Over the past couple of days, I've been grappling with the fact that someone beat me to the Georgia Tech deal. But, that doesn't mean that there aren't other organizations who want to work with Solid. The problem is that I'm not connected with them. When Didier wanted to learn about Solid, he found my networking event and came to it. But, most organizations interested in Solid contact Inrupt directly because they're the ones that the New York Times and BBC reported on. I know from Paul that this results in a situation where Inrupt is in control of many Solid contracts despite being a company uninterested in contracting. You can work with Inrupt to do one of these contracts, but they'll take an extremely heavy cut of your work and force you to use their enterprise server. But, what if anyone could put let everyone know what they're all about the same way Inrupt did through the New York Times and BBC articles. Essentially these articles were RFPs for companies and governments to come forward to Inrupt with the use cases they wanted satisfied. Though, getting this RFP to a wide range of people required Inrupt to raise a lot of money and hire a PR firm. Not to mention, Tim has a draw about him. But, most people (especially early companies) don't have those resources.</p>
  <p>The RFP way of thinking can extend to use cases like "I as company x want to lower my cost for lumber refinement" or something like that. We could flip the sales cycle on its head. Instead of companies spending a bunch of effort pitching to a ton of other companies (many of which aren't interested in what you're selling), potential buyers could post what they're looking for and then companies can respond to that. It levels the playing field for new players because they don't need a network to compete if potential buyers just post their interests and you can search for those interests.</p>
  <p>So, what if there were a platform where I could search for organizations interseted in "Solid," or "Decentralized Identity," and connect with them instead of doing a bunch of random sales. It's similar to an idea Doc Searls had in his book "The Intention Economy." But, that idea was less sales oriented and more about consumers posting what they wanted so companies selling products could give it to them. I always thought this use case was interesting, but it would be hard to change consumer behavior. But, this is more compelling. If I could make it easier for your company to make sales or just make connections people would jump on it.</p>
  <p>The big people to convince are the people posting the RFPs. If I post an RFP, I might get thousands of responses filling my inbox and that's not a service, it's annoying. Especially if these people don't satisfy my needs. Another problem is that I may not want to post a public RFP because then my competitors would know what I'm interested in. But, we can solve this problem with credentials. I don't have to reveal who I am when I post and RFP. Instead, I could have a credential that proves I represent a Fortune 1000 organization, and that's all the public needs to know. And to filter out annoying applicants we could have credentials that prove the applicant's skills, like "I worked for this company for x years."</p>
  <p>It's a good thing I'm moving to SF because I feel like this is the kind of thing that could really take of in San Francisco. But, the product is simple, getting users is going to be the interesting part. Fortunatley, having a network of startup founders and VCs works perfectly for this. If I can get a few VCs to start posting on the platform all at once, that could generate enough demand for people using it. At first the VCs can link people to their requests on Twitter, but once enough people are using the platform, they'll get responses from people they wouldn't have had before.</p>
  <p>It's a chicken and egg problem, but by asking VCs to get in on this first, we can get the ball rolling.</p>
  <p>So, the next step is planning. I need to get mocks and an architecture diagram. I should also start talking with some people I'm closer to to get a group of initial users.</p>
  <p>Finally, this is a good use case for Solid because it requires verifiable credentials to function. I already bought the domain name: WarmIntro.cc because it's better than a cold intro. You have your credentials on your side.</p>
