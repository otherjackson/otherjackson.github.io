  <h1>The great drive U-Haul trip of 2021 (2021-01-11)</h1>
  <p>I am exhausted, but extremely proud of us. We did so much today!</p>
  <p>I began the day by running to the phone repair place where they said they took the phone and said they could replace the charging port for $150. Part of me was hoping the entire phone was broken so that I'd have an excuse to get the latest Samsung Galaxy S20, but in the end, that wouldn't be too cost effective. They still haven't emailed me back about the phone, so I'll go check on that tomorrow</p>
  <p>I see the benefit to New York. It's a little dirty for my taster (or at least the lower eastside is), but everything is so convenient. The fact that I'm surrounded by good restaurants and useful services in just a few blocks is amazing!</p>
  <p>Having no phone no internet in our apartment, we set up in the Internet Cafe one last time. Ailin got caught up on work while I had a short meeting with Matthieu, but informed him that I wouldn't be working today. I also booked a U-Haul for the great furniture pickup.</p>
  <p>Then it began. Ailin and I have been looking at Nextdoor and craigslist to find free furniture. Unfortunately, none of my prospects worked out, but Ailin found two desks and a chair. We took the MTA to Brooklyn to pick up our van, but trouble began once we arrived. Because I didn't have my phone, they weren't able to verify my existence. The entire signup process for getting the UHaul was extremely convoluted and it took about an hour to get through it! At one point, I thought we should just cut our losses and come back when my phone is fixed, but Ailin persisted, getting in contact with UHaul support via Twitter when they wouldn't respond anywhere else. She's amazing! It's because of her we were able to accomplish so much today!</p>
  <p>We started by picking up a desk and all our boxes in Manhattan. To be honest, I felt a little tense driving. Driving is a different experience in New York, especially in a large van. I may have accidentally nicked a two cars with my mirror. Fortunately, it looks like the mirror is designed to spring back when that happens. Later in the day a man flashed kept flashing his lights at me. I didn't know what he wanted so I got out of the van to ask. Apparently my lights were off :| Maybe I shouldn't be on the road haha.</p>
  <p>We went to Brooklyn Ikea to pick up the furniture that we hadn't received online. But before we shopped, we got a late lunch. We had to eat in our car because of Covid, but it was wonderfully rewarding considering we hadn't eaten since Ailin got Dunkin doughnuts in the morning.</p>
  <p>Our final stop was in queens to pick up a desk and chair from a friendly couple who were downsizing. We made our way back to unload everything at our apartment. Then returned the UHaul a little bit late.</p>
  <p>When we got back to the apartment, we unpacked and assembled furniture into the evening, and I must say, I'm feeling fantastic about our new workspace. We have proper desks and chairs (as well as a cool light fixture that makes it feel like we're in a crystal cave)!</p>
