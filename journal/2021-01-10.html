  <h1>Settling in (2021-01-10)</h1>
  <p>Today, we spent the morning unpacking and rearranging furniture. We decided that the back room would be the bedroom, the entire middle room would be the kitchen and include a kitchen table and the front room would be our office with two desks and a couch. I love the front room! It has so much natural light! I'll show pictures of the place once we have everything set up.</p>
  <p>We can't move in completely because we have to pick up boxes containing the rest of our stuff tomorrow, so we decided to spend the afternoon having a bit of fun.</p>
  <p>First, we went to the local Pickle restaurant (Called Dill) and I got what I believe to be the best Beyond Burger I have ever had. I haven't had a burger this good since I gave up eating beef! I'm super happy that we live so close, and I'll definitely be a frequent customer.</p>
  <p>After a delicious meal, Ailin and I walked down to the highline with a plan to walk to the Vessel and Hudson yards. The Vessel was too busy, but we did enjoy the walk. New York does not feel locked down for Covid 19. Other than the fact that no one can dine inside restaurants and we needed the register to go on the Highline, it felt just like Atlanta's Covid procedures. I don't think there's going to be any significant hamper on our New York experience due to the pandemic.</p>
  <p>I would show some pictures, but my phone charging port broke and I need to get it fixed (or buy a new phone). But overall, it was a fun day!</p>
