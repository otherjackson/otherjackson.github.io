  <h1>A need for improvement (2021-01-06)</h1>
  <p>I need to improve.</p>
  <p>Of course I got the standard things like my Chinese lesson done today, but that's normal at this point. I need to continually push myself and today was not fantastic.</p>
  <p>I hardly did any chat app work at all. Partially through the day, Justin messaged me with some side task that needed to get done and I procrastinated all day on it. I watched way too much live news coverage of the Capitol building insurrection. I didn't need to do that. I could have just read the news after it all happened. I did finish the task for Justin but only late at night. I also spent a lot of time just walking around thinking, which is something I need to curb. And to top it all off, I'm not doing any favors for my sleep by staying up until one. I feel kinda physically terrible as well. I think I need to improve my diet and sleep schedule. I'm also not exercising :(</p>
  <p>But on a lighter note, I had my bi-weekly conversation with Tim and he seemed really excited about the Georgia Tech prospect. It fell in line with recent work he's been doing connecting the Solid data browser to semantic web sources like Dbpedia. While Tim and I disagree on the future of the data browser (he sees it as an integral part of Solid and I see it as something that should be rid of and replaced with more modern applications) I like that fact that someone has started to integrate wide datasources.</p>
  <p>In order to improve, I'm going to make a list of the things that I should do tomorrow:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Wake up on time 8:00am</li>
    <li>Breakfast (healthy)</li>
    <li>Exercise</li>
    <li>Shave</li>
    <li>Shower</li>
    <li>Chinese Lesson</li>
    <li>Chat App (gotta get as much of it done as possible)</li>
    <li>Lunch at 1:00</li>
    <li>Chat App</li>
    <li>Dinner at 8:00</li>
    <li>Relax</li>
    <li>Get ready for bed at 10:00</li>
    <li>Journal Entry</li>
    <li>Go to bed at 11:00pm</li>
  </ul>
