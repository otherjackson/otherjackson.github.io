  <h1>On to O (2021-02-23 to 2021-03-02)</h1>

  <p>It's onto the next era of work! Let's go!</p>

  <h2>2021-02-23 to 2021-02-25</h2>

  <p>I spent Tuesday and Wednesday finishing up a few things on the IdP. I adjusted the code to fit Ruben's feedback and adjusted the client-id branch to be in line. The Solid-Client-Authn team still hasn't updated the client to work with clientids so I just told Matthieu the adjustment he'll need to make once they finish it. I completed most of the work.</p>
  <p>In what I hope to be the last time I ever touch NSS, I was asked to add refresh token support to NSS's IdP.</p>
  <p>And with that, I'm done with IdP work until I pick it up for O. I have some things scoped out for CSS in the future, but they weren't in Inrupt's contract.</p>
  <p>Meanwhile, I talked with Jonathan about the changes to the pitch deck that need to be made. Apparently, it contained way too much text. I was under the impression that investors should be able to understand everything just from reading the deck without me present to explain anything, but apparently it's more attractive to tell a more engaging visual story. So I adjusted the slide deck.</p>
  <p>Jonathan also gave me a few tips about pitching to investors. The key is confidence. You want to portray yourself as someone who know exactly what needs to be done.</p>
  <p>So, to finsish up the pitch deck and build that confidence, I wrote out everything that we need to do for the MVP and put a "person hour" prediction on each task. Then assuming 14 person hours between two developers over two week sprints, I estimated the number of sprints required to deliver an MVP to be 14. Then I took that number and doubled it to get 14 months to deliver the MVP (9 months with 3 developers). The estimate is conservative as I didn't count myself as a developer (and I plan to do some development with things that I'm an expert thing) and I doubled the predicted estimate. If I give this number to investors, it should put us in a good position to really impress them so we can raise a higher seed round later.</p>
  <p>I also got a haircut that Ailin likes :D</p>

  <h2>2021-02-26</h2>
  <p>On Friday things really started to kick off for O! I began the day with my monthly Solid networking meeting. Unfortunately, I messed up the invite and it was confusing for a lot of people to join (I'll fix that for next month), but I did learn through Liam of Lifescope that Dmitri is working on a verifiable credentials integration for Solid. VCs are a requirement for O's MVP. So, I set up a meeting later in the day to talk to Dmitri. I offered him help in integrating his work into the spec and CSS. He seemed pretty excited about it!</p>
  <p>After the networking meeting, I synced up with Brad to get a review of the pitch deck. He gave a few minor pointers and mentioned a few firms he could recommend for me. He said he'd reach out to them. No word on that yet, but I'm happy to meet with them if we get connected.</p>
  <p>Next was the meeting with Ann, and I think it went really well. I talked to her about the market predictions and go to market plan as well as the resources required. I think she was pleasantly surprised given how poorly organized I was when I first met her. She said that everything I said makes sense and we can go forward with funding. The next step would be to meet with another Floodgate partner Arjun. The check's not in hand, but I'm feeling pretty good about it now.</p>
  <p>With funding upcoming, I switched to full-time recruiter mode. I reached out to anyone I could think of in my personal network asking them if they'd be open to working in a startup. Most said that they were happy in their job, but I started setting up meetings for others who said they might be interested.</p>
  <p>Two people got back to me before the end of the day and I scheduled a meeting with them. The first was James Park, currently at Microsoft, who seemed to think the idea was huge, but wanted to focus on his own idea. Maybe I can convince him to build his idea as a Databrowser applet sometime haha. The second was with Gene Gonalez, a back-end focused engineer at Google. He does hardware now, but he'd be fine with full software backend work. He also seemed interested, and he asked the right questions indicating he's thinking through the design and not just buying into the hype.</p>

  <h2>2021-02-27 to 2021-02-28</h2>
  <p>It's a rainy weekend so Ailin and I decided to stay indoors. That means book writing! I completed half of Chapter 10.</p>
  <p>I have three more meetings on Saturday.</p>
  <p>First was Phillipe Kimura-Thollander. He's a UX designer currently working at Facebook. I stressed that I don't have enough work for a full time designer, but the UX challenge of the databrowser means that we should have a UX designer influence the MVP from a part time position. He seemed interested and also asked the right questions. So, I'm hopeful that he'd be a good fit for a design role. I've seen him reading the big Google doc a lot in recent days.</p>
  <p>Next was June Park, currently a data engineer at Groundspeed Analytics. She expressed interest in the idea but said that she didn't feel like she was skilled enough to do. I assured her that I wouldn't want her feeling that she wasn't good enough to affect how much she wanted to work on the product. Skill level is for me to determine and she had surpassed the barrier for me to consider her. This reminds me of one of Ailin's work collegues who didn't accept a job offer at IBM because she didn't feel like she was skilled enough. I think that in these situations it's the responsibility of the employer to help clear up that anxiety. If you were to ask me a year ago, I would have said that it's the responsibility of the individual to "lean in," echoing Sheryl Sandberg, but Ailin pointed out that there are lots of situations where people in power can do even more to empower an individual, so I'd like to help in those situ ations. June said that she'd like to read more and has also been reading the Google doc.</p>
  <p>The final call on Saturday was with Andrea, who also stressed that she doesn't feel like she's good enough. I reassured her, but she was much more insistant than June. So, we spent the rest of the time catching up and talking about other candidates that could work. We agreed that Titus was the best, but she also recommended that I chat with Richard Li who isn't looking for full time work, but might know some good people looking for some.</p>

  <h2>2021-03-01</h2>
  <p>Monday was more full-time recruiting. I reached out to a lot more people in my LinkedIn network including most everyone I knew from the KPCB Fellows program. I also made a job listing on Angellist.</p>
  <p>Jonathan got back to me with another potential investor: Ali Partovi of Neo. Also in the email was Jenny Wang, who I eventually realized was the same Jenny Wang in my KPCB Fellows cohort. Is the valley that small?! We set up a meeting for next week to discuss. Jonathan told me Ali loves very technical projects, so it might be a good fit.</p>
  <p>I had a doctors appointment at noon to get my vision checked. I've needed to up the font on my computer, so I thought I needed new glasses, and I was right. After getting the perscription, I went directly to the Warby Parker at Grand Central station to get some new glasses that looked as close to my current ones as possible.</p>
  <p>While there, I took a call with Thiago to update him on the investing situation. Turns out, when you get one investor to devote to you, other investors get interested! Thiago said he would be interested in investing not thought engage (which is much more B2B focused), but through Tech Square Ventures. They could be a strategic partner due to their foucs on dev tools, something that is a big portion of the Databrowser ecosystem. I bought Chic-Fil-A near grand central to have an Altanta celebration thanks to this call!</p>
  <p>There were two more recruiting calls:</p>
  <p>The first was with Janet Liang. I didn't know this before talking to her, but she's worked for a blockchain company before, and while Solid doesn't use blockchain, she knows what it's like to work in a DWeb ecosystem, and therefore asked a lot of the right questions.</p>
  <p>Second was with Richard Li, he didn't know anyone looking for full time work as Andrea thought, but I did get to hear about his research at University of Washington which could be cool in the databrowser down the line. It's focused on novel methods of input and output. The project he's working on now is around augmented reality with sound.</p>

  <h2>2021-03-02</h2>
  <p>Today, I woke up to a huge number of responses to the Angellist post and my linkedin messages. It's getting a bit unwieldy so I plan to make a spreadsheet to organize them. Before today I was feeling a bit scared about recruiting, but I feel like a have quite a few options now. It's just about getting organized. Just goes to show that apparently spamming everyone you know and more is the recipe for finding talent!</p>
  <p>I had my final debrief with Matthieu and also talked with Joy about her new masters project. At 8pm today I have my next conversation with Floodgate with Arjun. Wish me luck!</p>
