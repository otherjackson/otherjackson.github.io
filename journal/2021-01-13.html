  <h1> (2021-01-13)</h1>
  
  <p>Today was a day of meetings, the most interesting of which was with Thiago. Of course I've been throwing spaghetti at the wall to see what sticks with Solid, but he helped me realize a few paths that can be taken. Self-sovereign identity (the system behind COVID verification), needs to be top down. It needs government and large organization backing. It's a large problem that if solved, would be profoundly impactful, but I don't see it working from a grassroots perspective because self-sovereign doesn't work unless governments and large organizations buy into a single standard. There may be an opportunity to do this with Solid because it already has support of the UK and Belgian governments, but to be sure, it would be great to have someone involved who has the connections to really push it. So, if we go the self Self-sovereign route, I'll need to ask for help in that department. We'd also be competing with a company called <a href="https://bindlesystems.com/">Bindle</a>.</p>
  <p>Alternatively, there's the killer app for Solid that can be a bit more grassroots. Making a data management platform that is extremely user friendly might be the way to go. It would be similar to ShapeRepo but targeted at a non-developer user-base. There's a rise in applications that allow users to basically build their own applications (things like retool and airtable). I could imagine a Solid data management platform that lets people easily set up new "apps" for organizing their own data and a community's data. For example, I've seen so many startups proposed that are along the lines of "Connect X with Y" as in "Connect people selling textbooks with people who want to buy textbooks." And we don't need a new app for that. We can set a data standard for it and let a generic UI render it.</p>
  <p>I'll definitely be taking some of these insights into my meeting with Ann on Friday.</p>
  <p>I also caught up with Joy, Katie and TJ. Though, I needed to cut my meeting with Joy short to hop on the meeting with Thiago. So, I'll need to call her again today.</p>
  <p>The Solid Team meeting today had the standard administrative updates. My work for automatic specification merging was acknowledged, and we discussed the emails that were coming into the Solid team account. Because Inrupt has been doing the large PR push, more people have been sending emails and a good many of them are people looking to get their companies involved. Though, as the Solid team, we can't really do any official alliance. All we can do it point them to helpful resources and hope they get involved.</p>
  <p>In the continuing mobile phone saga, I found that I will need a new phone to get on T-Mobile, but I need to wait for a SIM card to be mailed to me. From there, I can take it to the T-Mobile store and buy a new phone. I'm super thankful for Tika. With her family plan I'll get unlimited data and save money!</p>
  <p>Finally, I got a good amount of IdP work done. </p>
  <p>I was quite hungry at the end of the day and we ate some noodles and oatmeal Ailin prepared. She talked about a proposal her manager had to move her into a more sales-like technical consultant role. She didn't like the idea of working in a more sales like role, but wondered if she should give it a try anyway. I encouraged her to only take a job if it's directly working to advance where she wants to be, and we discussed the prospect of leaving IBM, so we'll see where that goes, but I'm hopeful for her future.</p>
  <p>Oh, I totally forgot about one thing we did yesterday. Ailin and I watched CES's top 5 awards and made fun of the gadgets that people were hyped for. One was literally just a ring with a button on it hahaha!</p>
