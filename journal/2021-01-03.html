  <h1>Improving the chat app (2021-01-03) (2021-01-03)</h1>
  <p>Today was almost entirely about improving the Solid Chat app I've been working on, Liqid Chat. In hindsight, it feels like I haven't done too much. Most adjustments were little things like "The text box should remain focused after the user sends a message" or "User Avatars shouldn't blink during state changes." But, despite the mundanity of these improvements, they still took a bit of work. Though, I learned quite a bit more about improving performance in React.</p>

  <p>The home stretch before app release is always about fixing a bunch of little things, but it's exciting because it means that Liqid chat is close to release! I'm hoping Liqid chat will become the most used app in the Solidverse. Solid needs an app that people will use on a daily basis if it's going to succeed, and a chat app is the best way to achieve that. Unfortunately, the chat apps that exist right now don't have all the features you would expect (Searching for friends, Mobile Apps for Android and iOS, and push notifications). Liqid chat will be the first Solid chat app to have all those features.</p>
  <p>Other than the chat app work, I read the next chapter of Marcus's book and gave him feedback. The two of us have been writing chapters and handing them off to one another. His previous chapter was amazing. I really enjoyed his magic system. This chapter was more boring and repetitive. But he seems excited to do some rewriting.</p>
