  <h1>Liqid chat pre-alpha (2021-01-18)</h1>
  <p>The past few days have been consumed with quarantine coding. Ailin's been learning typescript and I've been trying to finally finish Liqid chat. I spent Saturday doing web notifications, Sunday doing mobile notifications, and Monday refactoring the notification code and deploying. So, now Liqid chat is finally in pre-alpha. It's a bit rough around the edges, but I'll continually improve it.</p>
  <p>So, here's the new plan. I'm going to harden Liqid chat in my free time while I complete the IdP work. Once the IdP work is done, I'm going to deploy my own Community Server at https://liqid.host as a companion to Liqid chat. Currently there isn't a deployment of the community server that I know of, so I think this will serve to help out the community.</p>
  <p>Another thing that the current community server lacks is a better onboarding experience. Right now, when you sign up, you don't know what apps you can use. I plan to build an app list that will be displayed when you sign up, and Liqid chat will definitely be in that list along with Media Kraken, the Inrupt Data Browser, and any other applications that work well with modern Solid servers. From there, that might be enough to do a little bit of a PR push to direct people to the Liqid suite.</p>
  <p>And the great thing is that I believe I can do this all without raising money. Hopefully that will put me in a stronger position when I return to Ann in a month.</p>
