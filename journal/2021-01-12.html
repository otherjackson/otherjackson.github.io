  <h1>An unproductive productive day (2021-01-12)</h1>
  <p>It felt like both a busy day and an unproductive day. Work wise, I took another day off from the Identity Provider. We had internet now, so we weren't blocked by that. Ruben T needs to answer one of my questions about ComponentsJS.</p>
  <p>I spent the morning organizing my clothes and belongings into my closet, then went to check on my cell phone. I had to go back three separate times! The first, to see if they had fixed it. They said the replaced the port but it still wasn't charging, so they would need to check the battery. The second time, they said replacing the battery didn't work, so the phone was dead and they just needed to reassemble it. And the third time, I picked up by bricked phone. The thing is, it isn't bricked. It was actually fixed! So I think I just got a free cell phone repair. Though, I already started the motions to get a new phone by contacting Tika about her plan. I'll go to the T-Mobile store tomorrow to see what my options are.</p>
  <p>I've been ignoring Chinese lessons for the past few days, so I picked that up again. Have I mentioned that now that I'm in the HSK-2 sections, things have gotten more intense. I was able to easily do two lessons a day before, but I think I need to decrease it to one per day now.</p>
  <p>Ailin and I enjoyed so much good food today! For lunch, I picked up some affordable dumplings from "Vanessa's Dumpling House," and for dinner, Ailin got Congee. I had never tried it, but I love it now. Ailin thought I would hate the 1000 year egg that came with it, but it just tasted like a regular egg with a slightly metal taste.</p>
  <p>I've arranged a meeting with Ann from floodgate on Friday and one with Thiago to get advice tomorrow. The timing could not be better. Just as floodgate is interested in Solid, Inrupt decided to do a big public relations push. I've seen articles in the New York Times and Reuters about it. Hopefully, the VCs at floodgate are taking notice!</p>
  <p>Despite the day being busy due to all the errands, I still feel unaccomplished. So, here's the list of what I'll do tomorrow to feel accomplished:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Figure out the phone plan.</li>
    <li>Do a Chinese Lesson</li>
    <li>Have a meeting with
      <ul>
        <li>Matthieu</li>
        <li>The Solid Team (it's the monthly meeting)</li>
        <li>Joy (she's been wanting to talk for a while)</li>
        <li>Thiago</li>
        <li>Possibly TJ and Katie</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Complete the routing infrastructure given Ruben T has responded</li>
    <li>Order Soylent? I know I've been having fun with all the food here, but it can't be healthy for my wallet.</li>
  </ul>
