    I'm Jackson Morgan. I wasn't the first Jackson and I won't be the last. Currently the top result for "Jackson
    Morgan" on Google is a liquor brand called <a href="http://www.sipjacksonmorgan.com/">Jackson Morgan Southern
      Cream</a>, a drink that I, ironically, cannot consume. There's also a <a
      href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jackson_Morgan_(footballer)">footballer from South Sudan</a> and <a
      href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Songs_written_by_Jackson_Morgan">singer from Texas</a>. Maybe one day
    I'll be prevalent enough to supersede these titans of Jacksoness, but until then, I'll be the Other Jackson.

I want to be sure it's my top skill. I don't really know how to make mayo, but I do enjoy it on the occasional sandwich.</li>
